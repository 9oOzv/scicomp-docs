Data

Data binds all research together today.  Even if you don't consider
yourself to do data-based research, the results of your work becomes
data before it is published.  Also, the highest levels of funding
agencies are beginning to demand good data management and openness.
Thus, knowing how to manage data is perhaps the most important
untaught modern skill.

But it's not just that: There are good and bad methods of managing
data.  For example,

* A **bad strategy** is to store everything in one folder on your own
  laptop: there's a very high chance that you will someday lose it all.
  A **better strategy** is to use a secure centralized service - preferably
  an Aalto service, since you get guaranteed support for free.

* A **bad strategy** is for everyone to do their own thing and put no effort
  into recording what they have done: in five years, when the group is
  almost completely changed, that data will be unusable.  A **better
  strategy** is to make sure things are documented and archived as soon
  you get them (and keep this up to date), so that the data can continue
  to serve you in the future.

* A **bad strategy** is to assume all data is proprietary Aalto information:
  eventually funders will demand more and you won't be prepared, and
  Aalto will remain an island, instead of a hub that others want to work
  with and build on.  A **better strategy** is to always consider openness,
  licensing, and privacy from the start (even if you don't do it right
  away), and always separate data based on level of confidentiality so
  that you can share or open later.

Data management strategies and plans
====================================

A "data management plan" (DMP) can mean a formal thing that funders
require (funder DMP).  However, it can also be a very practical thing
for your daily work that guides your collaboration (practical DMP).
This section will contains some information on both, but focused on
the latter.

For information on Funder DMPs, see the `Aalto Research Data
Management pages`__.  We recommend that you first think about your
practical DMP, so that the Funder DMP comes naturally.  The Funder DMP
has more of a focus on sharing, standardization, and openness.

Aalto data storage
==================

Aalto provides many tools and resources for storing data.  Overall,
you should try to store the master copy of your data on some
centralized storage system - which Aalto provides for free and can be
accessed from any computer.  By storing on a central system, you get
backups, sharing, large amounts of space, and guaranteed support.

.. note::

   While this should theoretically be possible anywhere in Aalto, we
   are still trying to make sure that this is sooth.
