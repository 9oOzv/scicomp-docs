Requesting to be added to a group
---------------------------------

.. note::

   **CS department**: New!  Group owners/managers can add members to
   their groups self-service.  Go to https://domesti.cs.aalto.fi from
   Aalto networks, over VPN, or remote desktop at
   https://vdi.aalto.fi, and it should be obvious.

Send an email to the responsible contact (see above) and **CC the
group owner or responsible person**, and include this information:

-  Group name that you request to join
-  copy and paste this statement, or something similar: "I am aware that
   all data stored here is managed by the group's owner and have read
   the data management policies."
-  Ask the group owner to reply with confirmation.
-  Do you need access to scratch or work? If so, you need a Triton
   account and you can request it now. If you don't, you'll get
   "input/output error" and be *very* confused.
-  Example:

     Hi, I (account=omes1) would like to join the group ``myprof``.  I
     am aware that all data stored here is managed by the group's
     owner and have read the data management policies.
     ``$professor_name``, please reply confirming my addition.

Requesting a new group
----------------------

Send an email to the responsible contact (see above) with the following information. Group
owners should be long-term (e.g. professor level) staff.

-  Requested group name (you can check the name from the lists below)
-  Owner of data (prof or long-term staff member)
-  Other responsible people who can authorized adding new members to the
   group. (they can reply and say "yes" when someone asks to join the
   group.)
-  Who is responsible for data should you become unavailable (default:
   supervisor who is probably head of department).
-  Initial members
-  Expiration time (default=max 2 years, extendable. max 5 years
   archive). We will ping you for management/renewal then.
-  Which filesystems and what quota. (project, archive, scratch). See
   the :doc:`the storage page <aalto-details>`.
-  Basic description of purpose of group.
-  Is there any confidential or personal data (see above for disclaimer).
-  Any other notes that CS-IT should enforce, for example check NDA
   before giving access.
-  Example:

       I would like to request a new group ``coolproject``. I am the
       owner, but my postdoc Tiina Tekkari can also approve adding
       members.  (Should I become unavailable, my colleague Anna
       Algorithmi (also a professor here) can provide advice on what
       to do with the data)

       We would like 20GB on the ``project`` filesystem.

       This is for our day to day work in algorithms development, we
       don't expect anything too confidential.
