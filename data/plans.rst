Data management plans
=====================

Data management plans are a catchphrase these days, mainly because
funders are requiring them now.  This is for a good reason -
researchers often focus on their papers, and making good use of the
data gets forgotten.  Funders pay a lot for research, and they want
*all* the possible value for society.

However, it *is* worth doing a bit of planning about data, even aside
from the required bureaucratic exercise.  It is true that researches
focus on the next paper.  Data has long-term value even inside Aalto,
and if you don't try hard it will get lost.  Do 

Practical DMP
=============

In this section, we outline recommend ways to use Aalto resources for
different use cases.

No matter what your project, you want to start by thinking how you
will handle your data (this can be "real data", notes, code, papers,
etc).  This will make sure that your team works together well and
doesn't end up with a big mess in a few months - or that you can't
work together because you can't share information.  For this, see the
`A4 DMP template`__.  This site is focused on practical DMPs.

Funder DMP
==========

There are plenty of other good resources about making funder DMPs.

* At Aalto, the RIS grantwriters have taken responsibility for helping
  to make good funder DMPs.

* The Aalto RDM pages have a subsection dedicated to `data management
  plans <aaltordm_>`_.

.. _aaltordm: http://www.aalto.fi/en/research/research_data_management/data_management_planning/


* The `DMPTuuli <https://www.dmptuuli.fi/>`_ is a combination
  template, instructions, and web form which makes it easy to do the
  mechanical assembly of DMPs.  This is highly recommended.

As some concrete suggestions:

* Funders are especially concerned about sharing, preservation,
  reproducibility, and
  dissemination but probably can't evaluate too much about the
  practical side of things.

* You can mention that you will follow the `Aalto RDM policy
  <aaltordm_>`_, which covers mainly opening and licensing.  The policy
  still allows you to make your own choices, but it sounds quite good
  if you refer to it and say you will follow it.

* For data storage considerations, you can say that your
  department/Science-IT provides data storage services (for Science-IT
  departments) and has a data storage policy which you will follow:
  :doc:`citation <outline>` and/or :doc:`full text <datapolicy>`.
