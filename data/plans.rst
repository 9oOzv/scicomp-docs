Data management plans
=====================

Data management plans are a catchphrase these days, mainly because
funders are requiring them now.  This is for a good reason -
researchers often focus on their papers, and making good use of the
data gets forgotten.  Funders pay a lot for research, and they want
*all* the possible value for society.

However, it *is* worth doing a bit of planning about data, even aside
from the required bureaucratic exercise.  It is true that researches
focus on the next paper.  Data has long-term value even inside Aalto,
and if you don't try hard it will get lost.  Do 

Practical DMP
=============

In this section, we outline recommend ways to use Aalto resources for
different use cases.

No matter what your project, you want to start by thinking how you
will handle your data (this can be "real data", notes, code, papers,
etc).  This will make sure that your team works together well and
doesn't end up with a big mess in a few months - or that you can't
work together because you can't share information.  For this, see the
`A4 DMP template <dmpA4_>`_.  This site is focused on practical DMPs.

* Suggested DMP for large experimental data (TODO)
* Suggested DMP for simulations or computer-generated data (TODO)
* Suggested DMP for data from humans (surveys, interviews, etc)
  (TODO)



Funder DMP
==========

There are plenty of other good resources about making funder DMPs.

* At Aalto, the RIS grantwriters have taken responsibility for helping
  to make good funder DMPs.

* The Aalto RDM pages have a subsection dedicated to `data management
  plans <aaltordm_>`_.

.. _aaltordm: http://www.aalto.fi/en/research/research_data_management/data_management_planning/


* The `DMPTuuli <https://www.dmptuuli.fi/>`_ is a combination
  template, instructions, and web form which makes it easy to do the
  mechanical assembly of DMPs.  This is highly recommended.

As some concrete suggestions:

* Funders are especially concerned about sharing, preservation,
  reproducibility, and
  dissemination but probably can't evaluate too much about the
  practical side of things.

* You can mention that you will follow the `Aalto RDM policy
  <aaltordm_>`_, which covers mainly opening and licensing.  The policy
  still allows you to make your own choices, but it sounds quite good
  if you refer to it and say you will follow it.

* For data storage considerations, you can say that your
  department/Science-IT provides data storage services (for Science-IT
  departments) and has a data storage policy which you will follow:
  :doc:`citation <outline>` and/or :doc:`full text <datapolicy>`.



Help!  I need a DMP right now!
==============================

If you are reading this, you probably have a grant deadline and you
need to do something *right now*.  Use the resources above, but here
is some more advice:

* Read the :doc:`data management outline <../data/outline>` on this
  site.  You should be able to pull many of the practical pieces
  (storage, confidentiality, archiving, etc) from here.

* Read the `Aalto-level guidelines <aalto_rdm_plans_>`_.

* To internally organize things, start with the `A4 DMP template
  <dmpA4_>`_.  This can't be used for something you submit, but lets
  you know the big picture.  If you fill this out first and give it to
  someone, they can guide you in making the next version.

* Use the `DMP Tuuli <https://www.dmptuuli.fi/>`_ tool to prepare the
  DMP.  It just makes a final document you can download (you could do
  the same using a word processor), but breaks everything down into a
  nice form.

Why do they want DMPs?  What should it include?  Answering these will
help you to make something competitive, even if you think you don't :

* The main purpose is to make sure that other researchers can use your
  results as easily as they can use your factual results.  Can other
  researchers access your data?  Can your results be reproduced?

* Most likely, whoever is reading doesn't care *that* much about the
  actual day to day data storage and so on, but more of the big
  picture: licensing, opening, archiving, sharing, preserving,
  expanding, securing.

* If you produce your own data, how can others use it?  Funders want
  open, but by giving good justification you can do whatever you need.
  If the data comes from others, then can you re-distribute (even for
  validation) or would others need to request it from the source?

* How software you make related to data processing (and really all
  software) will be handled.  Even if data can't be released, software
  can be open sourced which allows reproduction of results, some sort
  of validation.

* How you preserve data for future use: both for you, and for others.

* You should mention how you will follow the "Aalto Research Data
  Management Policy and related guidance".  The policy just says "you
  will make strategic decisions", so sounds good while not binding you
  to anything.

* For storage, organization, confidentiality, etc, you can say you
  will follow the Science-IT data management policy.  This isn't
  requirements for you, but the default services we offer for data
  storage (designed to keep data safe and secure, and uuushareable).  It
  also sounds good to say.  (see the :doc:`outline <outline>`)
