Cluster general prerequisites
=============================

The following topics are required background knowledge for productive
use of a remote computer cluster, and not covered in the following
sequence of tutorials.  You should at least browse these to confirm
that you know the basics here.

* The "Shell crash course".  You can :doc:`read it (10-20 min)
  </scicomp/shell>`, watch a `short version (20 min)
  <https://youtu.be/56p6xX0aToI>`__ or `longer version (1 hour)
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESXLbtaxpdI&list=PLZLVmS9rf3nN_tMPgqoUQac9bTjZw8JYc&index=3&t=1402s>`__.
  The shorter options are fine.

Open the :doc:`../ref/index` - you don't need to know what is on it
(that is what these tutorials cover), but having it open now and
during your work will help you a lot.
