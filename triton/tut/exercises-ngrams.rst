Ngrams exercises
================

This series of exercises computes word or character ngrams based on
fiction books in Project Gutenberg.  This page has all of the
exercises about ngrams inserted here, with links to their original
locations.  You will have to refer to the main pages to figure out how
to do the exercises.  The `code is on GitHub
<https://github.com/AaltoSciComp/hpc-examples/tree/master/ngrams>`__.

The general outline:

- Looking at data storage and the dataset that is already on the cluster
- Copying over your own personal copy of the data (make a duplicate
  dataset)
- Copy over the code (clone a Git repository)
- Run the code on the cluster's login node
- Run the code on the cluster itself
- Run the code in parallel
