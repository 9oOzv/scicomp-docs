Triton accounts
===============

You need to request Triton access separately, however, the account
information (username, password, shell,
etc) is shared with the Aalto account so there is not actually a
separate account. Triton access is available to any researcher at
Aalto for free.  Resources are funded by departments, and distributed
by a fairshare algorithm: members of departments and schools which
provide direct funding have a greater share.

Please contact us via the :doc:`support email address <help>` via the
support email address and we will set up your account.

A few prerequisites:

-  you must have valid Aalto account
-  you must have working email address (Aalto)
-  you must accept :doc:`Triton usage
   policies <usagepolicy>`: requesting access to
   Triton cluster at Aalto University, you accept all the conditions
   listed in the Triton usage policies.
-  You should tell us your department/school in your account creation
   request.

You should have Triton access if you are in the ``triton-users``
group at Aalto: ``groups`` shows this on Aalto linux machines.

Password change and other issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since your Triton account is a regular Aalto account, for any password
change, shell change etc use Aalto services.  You can always do these on
the server kosh.aalto.fi (at least).

If you are in doubts, in case of any account related issue your
primary point of contact is your local support team member via the
support email address. Do not post such issues on the tracker.

Account disabling/deleting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your account currently lasts as long as your Aalto account does.  If you
want to end your account early, contact us. This way you also get
unsubscribed from triton-users maillist. Before you leave, please clean
up your home/work/scratch directories data and let your local support
team member to know that you are done.  Consider who should have your
data after you are done. Note that scratch/work directory data are
unrecoverable after deleting.
