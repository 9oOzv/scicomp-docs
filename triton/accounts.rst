Triton accounts
===============

You need to request a Triton account from your local Triton support
member, however, the account information (username, password, shell,
etc) is shared with the Aalto account. Triton access is available on
request for Aalto School of Science staff and students.

Please contact your `local Triton support team
member <LINK/Getting%20help>`__ and we will set up your account.  You
can come by in person, or you can contact us by your department's normal
IT mail address (PHYS,NBE,CS,ELEC).

A few prerequisites:

-  you must have valid Aalto account
-  you must have working email address
-  you must accept `Triton usage
   policies <LINK/Triton%20usage%20policy>`__: requesting access to
   Triton cluster at Aalto University, you accept all the conditions
   listed in the Triton usage policies

Password change and other issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since your Triton account is a regular Aalto account, for any password
change, shell change etc use Aalto services.  You can always do these on
the server kosh.aalto.fi (at least).

If you are in doubts, in case of any account related issue your primary
point of contact is your local support team member. Do not post such
issues on the tracker.

Account disabling/deleting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your account currently lasts as long as your Aalto account does.  If you
want to end your account early, contact us. This way you also get
unsubscribed from triton-users maillist. Before you leave, please clean
up your home/work/scratch directories data and let your local support
team member to know that you are done.  Consider who should have your
data after you are done. Note that scratch/work directory data are
unrecoverable after deleting.
