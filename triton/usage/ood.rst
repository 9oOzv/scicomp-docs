Open OnDemand
=============

.. _ood:


.. warning::

   Triton OOD is under development and is available as a preview/for
   feedback.  It may or may not work at any given time as work on it.
   It is probably best to use our :ref:`chat <chat>` to give quick
   feedback.

Open OnDemand is a web-based interface to computer clusters.  It
provides a low-threshold way to do easy work and shell access to do
more.  It complements, not replaces, the traditional ssh access: just
like with Jupyter, it may help you get started, but most people will
eventually move towards shell access (even if that shell is via Open
OnDemand).


Connecting
----------

Address: http://ood.triton.aalto.fi .  Log in with the usual Aalto
login.  Connections only from Aalto
networks or VPN.  A pre-existing :doc:`Triton account <../accounts>`
is needed.



How to use
----------

The first view is a dashboard that provides an interface to a number
of applications:

* Shell: Top bar → Clusters → Triton shell access.  Or via the file
  manager.
* Files: Top bar → Files → choose your directory.  You can upload and
  download files this way.
* Other applications via the main page or Top bar → Interactive Apps →
  (choose).



Applications
------------

Once logged in, there are ways to start separate applications, for
example Jupyter.  These run as separate, independent processes.

We have these applications available and supported:

* Jupyter
* RStudio
* Matlab
* Spyder
* Code Server
* ...

Choose partition 'interactive' and a correct account.


Current issues
--------------

* Apps will be adjusted.
