Open OnDemand
=============

.. warning::

   Triton OOD is under development and is available as a preview/for
   feedback.  It may or may not work at any given time as work on it.
   It is probably best to use our :ref:`chat <chat>` to give quick
   feedback.

Open OnDemand is a web-based interface to computer clusters.  It
provides a low-threshold way to do easy work and shell access to do
more.  It complements, not replaces, the traditional ssh access: just
like with Jupyter, it may help you get started, but most people will
eventually move towards shell access (even if that shell is via Open
OnDemand).
