Getting Triton help
===================

The Triton docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case you got to this page directly, you are now on the Triton
documentation site. See `the main page <index>`
for the index.

Tracker
~~~~~~~

We keep track of cluster issues
at https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/AaltoScienceIT/triton/issues. Feel
free to post your issue there. Either admins or one of the experienced
users can reply. The system is accessible from anywhere in the world,
but you need to login with your Aalto account. All newly created issues
are reported to admins by email.

This is primary support channel and meant for general issues like
general help, troubleshooting, problems with code, new software
requests, problems that may affect several users.

Email ticketing system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For private issues you can also contact us via `our email alias`__
(available from our Wiki page - login required). This is primarily
intended for specific issues such as requesting new accounts, quotas,
etc.  Please avoid using personal emails as people may be absent. You
will get the fastest response via the tracker, and more people may
be able to provide hints.

Users' mailing list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All cluster users are on the triton-users mailing list (automagically
kept in sync with those who have Triton access).  It is for
announcements and open discussions mainly, for problem solving please
try the tracker.

If you do not receive list emails, you'd better check out with your
local Triton admin that you are on the list. Otherwise you miss all the
announcements including critical ones about maintenance breaks.

In person
~~~~~~~~~

You can also come and talk to us face-to-face, but of course we have to
be in-office.  This is especially useful when there is an open-ended
question where we have to discuss what is the best solution.  We may
then ask you to open a ticket once there is an answer, so that we can
track the progress and not forget.

Triton support team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most of us are members of your department's support teams, so can answer
questions about balancing use of Triton and your department's
computers.  There is also the Aalto IT Services support who handles
Aalto-wide issues.
