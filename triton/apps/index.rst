Software policy
---------------

We want to support all software, but unfortunately time is limited.
In the chart below, we have these categories:

* A: Full support and documentation, should always work
* B: We install and provide best-effort documentation, but may be out
  of date.
* C: Basic info, no guarantees

Other applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you know some application which is missing from this list but is
widely in use (anyone else than you is using it) it would make sense
install to ``/share/apps/`` directory and create a module file. Drop
your request on tracker to wishlist.
