speech2text: easy speech transcription
======================================

speech2text is a wrapper we have made around the `Whisper
<https://openai.com/research/whisper/>`__ tool to make it easier to
run for a wide audience.  Fundamentally, it's a wrapper around the
command line tool + set of instructions for transferring data in a way
that (hopefully) can't go too wrong.

You can read the instructions here:

If you use speech2text, you are using Triton and any outputs (papers,
thesis, conference publications) should acknowledge Triton, and :doc:`link
it to the "Science-IT" infrastructure in ACRIS
<../acknowledgingtriton>` once it is published.  You might get an
email each year reminding you to do this.
