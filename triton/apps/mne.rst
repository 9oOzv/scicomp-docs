::

    module load mne

Follow the instruction to source the init script specific to your shell.
In the directory::

    $MNE_ROOT/..

you can find the relase notes, the manual, and some sample data.

We do not recommend using the MNE command line tools, a more modern solution is to use the MNE-python suite.
