   * * ssh
     * Standard way of connecting.  Hostname is ``triton.aalto.fi``,
       for Linux/Mac ``ssh triton.aalto.fi``.

       Connections only from VPN and Aalto networks.
       ``kosh.aalto.fi`` is a good jump host.

       is not Triton, but from here you can ssh to Triton (see
       previous row)

       directly on Triton.
