This continues the example project we set up.  The code you need for
the following exercises were set up in :doc:`the cluster-shell
tutorial </triton/tut/cluster-shell>`, section
:ref:`triton-tut-exercise-repo`.

..
    : `hpc-examples <https://github.com/AaltoSciComp/hpc-examples>`__.
    You can clone the repository by running
    ``git clone https://github.com/AaltoSciComp/hpc-examples.git``.  This repository
    will be used for most of the tutorial exercises.
