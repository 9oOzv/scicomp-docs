Triton user guide
=================

Triton is the Aalto high-performance computing cluster.  It serves all
of Aalto, but is currently coordinated from within the School of
Science.  Access is free for researchers.  It is similar to the CSC
clusters, though CSC clusters are larger and Triton is easier to use
because it is more integrated into the Aalto environment.
