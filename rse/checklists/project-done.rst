RSE project done
================


Discuss with the researchers:

* Explicitly confirm with customers that we are ending our focus on
  this project and won't do more until we hear from them again.
* Confirm it is publicly released, licensed, everything is done (or
  discuss what else might need to be done).
* Discuss what to do if there are issues in the future - garage, issue
  tracker, training courses.
* Discuss what else may (or may not) need doing in the future.


Internal tasks:

* Issue tracker:

  * ``/summary`` should contain a several sentence summary focused on the
    benefit to the community (this is used for final reports, etc)
  * Confirm other metadata is correct

    * ``/contact``, ``/supervisor`` contains
      people who may get emails about the project later (and shouldn't
      contain people who may be surprised about automated survey
      emails)
    * ``/timesaved``
    * Outputs ``/projects``, ``/publications``, ``/software``,
      ``/datasets``, ``/outputs``

* Add it to the next meeting agenda, give report about what we learned
  from it
