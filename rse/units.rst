For units such as departments
-----------------------------

Our pilot is funded by departments and schools, and members of these
units can receive the basic services free of charge (in accordance to
the shares of funding).  If a research group would like dedicated
advanced services (see list above), they can directly fund this
program.  This could be, for example, co-funding salaries or

Benefits to schools/departments:

* Increase the quality of efficiency of your research.  Your
  researchers focus on their science while improving their coding
  skills passively.
* Provide hands-on technical research services to your community at a
  higher level than basic IT.

Benefits to groups:

* Receive staff/on-call software development expertise within your
  group, without having to fund or hire a full-time.
* Your RSEs get joint training and share competence within our RSE
  group.
