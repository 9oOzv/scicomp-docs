For units such as departments
-----------------------------

Our pilot is funded by departments and schools, and members of these
units can receive the basic services free of charge (in accordance to
the shares of funding). In addition to the basic service, researchers
can request :doc:`dedicated advanced services <researchers>` (see list
above). Advanced services are funded directly by the research group 
and their funding replaces part of their unit's share.

.. admonition:: Case study: Systematic improvements

   Your department has a lot of people doing little bits of
   programming everywhere, but everyone is doing things alone. What
   if they could work together better? By joining the RSE program as
   a unit, your staff can get up to X hours of free help to understand
   tools to make their programming/data work better. After a few
   years, you notice a dramatic cultural shift: there is more
   collaboration and higher-quality work. Perhaps you already see a
   change in your KPIs.

Benefits
--------

Benefits to schools/departments:

* Increase the quality of efficiency of your research.  Your
  researchers focus on their science while improving their coding
  skills passively.
* Provide hands-on technical research services to your community at a
  higher level than basic IT.
* Help with data management and FAIR data - be more competitive for
  funding, help get value out of your unit's data.

Benefits to groups:

* Receive staff/on-call software development expertise within your
  group, without having to fund or hire a full-time.
* Your RSEs get joint training and share competence within our RSE
  group.

How to join
-----------

The RSE program is a part of Aalto Science-IT (Aalto Scientific Computing),
so is integrated to our computing and data management infrastructure
and training programs.  You don't just get a service, but a connection to a
community of experts.
