For grant applicants
====================

.. warning::

   Grant applicants, if you are planning to use Aalto Research Software Engineers service, feel free to contact us at rse-group at aalto.fi, or fill out our `request form <https://selfservice.esupport.aalto.fi/ssc/app#/order/2026/>`__.

   This page is currently (2021-08) our best understanding of what is
   possible.  However, we are still exploring what works and doesn't,
   so contact us early so we can work out bugs together.  Please send
   corrections to us.


If you've decided you would like to use the :doc:`research software
engineer <index>` services in your project for a long period, you
might want to write it directly into your grant proposals.  If written
correctly, this can increase your competitiveness:
your research will be better because you can you can assign
porting/optimizing/scaling of codes, data management and open science,
automation, and so on for the RSEs, while concentrating the main
project resources on the actual research question.



How it works
------------

Short-term services are funded by various departments and schools and
free to the users (part of the "research environment" services).
Longer term service should be funded by projects - either an external grant or
basic funds.  There are two ways to write this into a project proposal:

* As a **purchased service**, like usage of different infrastructures.
  This is flexible, but not compatible with some funders.  It should
  work will with internal, basic funding.

* As a **research salary**, just like other salaries on your project.
  This has fewer limits, but is less flexible because we need to go
  through HR and financial planning.



General grant considerations
----------------------------

You can find general boilerplate text to include in your proposals
:doc:`/about/for-proposals`, but you can read below to build it in
even more.

Data Management / Open Science are big deals among some funders right
now, and research engineers are perfect for helping with these things
because they are experts in the associated technical challenges.  The
RSE service can help in the societal impact sections: your outputs
will be more ready to be reused by society.  You could, for example,
promise deliver more types of outputs that aren't exactly novel
science but help society to use your results (e.g. databases,
interactive visualisations, etc.).

Make sure you mention the general Science-IT infrastructure in the
"research environment" section, i.e., the basic service provided by
Aalto.  You can copy something from the boilerplate text (first link
in this section).



Academy of Finland
------------------

This applies to most general research grants, from the `general terms
and conditions
<https://www.aka.fi/en/research-funding/apply-for-funding/how-to-use-funding/>`__.
Funding may be used to cover costs related to the research plan or
action plan.  The research site must fund basic project facilities -
which is the case at Aalto for basic RSE services.

Interesting terms from the Academy: it urges research data and methods
to be freely available.  6.2.2: "Research data and material produced
with Academy funding in research projects and research infrastructure
projects must be made freely available as soon as possible after the
research results have been published."  We are experts in exactly
this.

* As a RSE salary:

  * Contact us and we will connect you with our controllers to work
    out costs.

  * "Salaries, fees and indirect employee costs" may be included in
    Academy projects.  These may go to research software engineers,
    which to the academy appear equivalent to "normal researchers".
    The RSEs *are* researchers.

  * Write in a Research Software Engineer as a salary for a set number
    of months.  You may specify a name as N.N., or contact us for a
    name to include.  We do *not* promise any one person,
    but we will work with you as much as possible.  Contact us for
    costs per person and we will put you in touch with our
    controllers.  You can also :doc:`contact us <request>` to
    discuss how much effort you may need.

  * The RSE and timeframe will be set at the beginning of the grant.
    It is possible to adjust later, but requires a significant amount
    of coordination between different services (thus the preference
    for the service purchase based approach, if it was possible).

  * Note that "We recommend that they be hired for a period of
    employment no shorter than the funding period, unless a shorter
    contract is necessary for special reasons dictated by the
    implementation of the research plan or action plan (or
    equivalent). Short-term research, studies or other assignments
    may also be carried out in the form of outsourced services."  So,
    consider this in justifying the research plan.

* As a service purchase:

  * .. warning::

      Our latest information indicates that internal billing (this
      service purchase) is not really possible for Academy grants.
      You must use "As a RSE salary" above.

  * Please contact us for general costs, and how many person-months
    you can get for a given price (it is roughly on "Staff Scientist"
    level).  Since estimating the amount of effort
    needed is difficult, :doc:`contact us <request>` and we can
    help you prepare with the help of our controllers.

  * The research site should provide "basic project facilities", which
    Aalto does.  Justify the extra purchase as beyond the basics.

  * Maximum amount: We recommend you include no more than XXXXX as a
    service purchase.  Please see LINK (login required) for our
    prices, when paid via external funding.

  * Justification for funding (include in proposal): "Technical
    specialist work to ensure scientific and societal impact outputs
    follow best practices in software development and research data
    management practices, so that they can be of greatest possible
    benefit to society."

  * Flexibility: we could flexibly invoice as needed for your
    project.  You don't have to decide the time period in
    advance (only follow your submitted budget), and different RSEs
    can work on different parts of the problem, so you always have the
    best person for the job.



European Commission grants
--------------------------

Internal billing is (for practical purposes) not possible
for EC grants.  Use the "RSE salary" as described for the Academy
of Finland above.
