For RSE candidates
------------------

Do you like coding and research, but don't want an academic career
path with publications as your sole purpose?  Be a Research Software
Engineer with us!  Our pilot is designed to bridge the gap between
academic research and a future career in research software or a
research scientist in a company.

If (some of) the following apply to you, you are a good candidate:

* I like the academic environment, but don't want to focus just on
  making publications.
* I am reasonably good at some programming concepts, and am eager to
  learn more.  I know one language well, can shell script, and
  generally familiar with Linux.
* I am interested in going to a scientist-developer kind of role in a
  company, but need more experience before I can make the transition.

We strongly prefer good computational researchers (PhD level
preferred) who can improve their software development skills than the
other way around.  This role can be combined with other roles, but
note that this is not targeted to those who intend to follow a
tenure-track academic career path.  New RSEs will get a training
period which rounds out any missing skills.  They will also be
involved in a complete support package: they will have the chance to
be involved in teaching an infrastructure development.
