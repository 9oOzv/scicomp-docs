Requesting RSE support
======================

.. warning::

   This page is still in draft form and being discussed and
   developed.  See the note on the parent page.


This page explains the typical process of contacting us and requesting
RSE support.

Medium or long-term, scheduled projects
---------------------------------------

If you have a long-term project as part of a grant coming in the
future, contact us to let us know.  For now, you can do that via the
issue tracker links below, or let us know by email.


Quick Consultations
-------------------

We recommend you come to our daily :ref:`garage sessions
<general-garage>` for a short chat.


Contact links
-------------

Our email is scicomp at aalto.fi.

You can request an initial consultation or submit a project request via Gitlab issues.
Use these direct links to select the template (on the version.aalto.fi login page,
click the "sign in with HAKA" button):

* `LINK: Request a
  consultation <consultation_>`__: quick initial consultation
* `LINK: Submit a new project request <new_project_>`__:
  a more involved project that spans days, weeks, or more.
* You can make the issue "confidential" so that others won't see (but
  it may be shared internal to Aalto for prioritization and
  reporting - don't submit confidential data), but we suggest that you 
  don't make it confidential so that we can all learn from each other.
* You can come to our :doc:`daily garage </help/garage>` or contact us
  by email at scicomp at aalto.fi.
