Requesting RSE support
======================

.. warning::

   This page is still in draft form and being discussed and
   developed.  See the note on the parent page.


This page explains the typical process of contacting us and requesting
RSE support.



Medium or long-term, scheduled projects
---------------------------------------

If you have a long-term project as part of a grant coming in the
future, contact us to let us know and we can be prepared.



Quick Consultations
-------------------

We recommend you come to our daily :ref:`garage sessions
<scicomp-garage>` for a short chat.



Contact
-------

Our email is rse-group at aalto.fi (the Triton email address
scicomp@aalto.fi also gets to us).

You can request an initial consultation or submit a project request
(really, it's not that different, since everything is read by a human):

* You can send an email to rse-group at aalto.fi or use our `request
  form <https://selfservice.esupport.aalto.fi/ssc/app#/order/2026/>`__
  ("Research Software Engineer requst").  The email can be free-form, the request form guides you to answer
  some useful questions.
* You can come to our :doc:`daily garage </help/garage>` and have a
  chat with us.
