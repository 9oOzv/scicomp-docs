Requesting RSE support
======================

.. warning::

   This page is still in draft form and being discussed and
   developed.  See the note on the parent page.


This page explains the typical process of contacting us and requesting
RSE support.

Medium or long-term, scheduled projects
---------------------------------------

If you have a long-term project as part of a grant coming in the
future, contact us to let us know.  For now, you can do that via the
issue tracker links below, or let us know by email.


Quick Consultations
-------------------

We recommend you come to our daily :ref:`garage sessions
<scicomp-garage>` for a short chat.


Contact links
-------------

..
  Our email is scicomp at aalto.fi.

..
  You can request an initial consultation or submit a project request via Gitlab issues.
  Use these direct links to select the template (on the version.aalto.fi login page,
  click the "sign in with HAKA" button):

..
  * `LINK: Request a
    consultation <consultation_>`__: quick initial consultation
  * `LINK: Submit a new project request <new_project_>`__:
    a more involved project that spans days, weeks, or more.
  * You can make the issue "confidential" so that others won't see (but
    it may be shared internal to Aalto for prioritization and
    reporting - don't submit confidential data), but we suggest that you
    don't make it confidential so that we can all learn from each other.

You can request an initial consultation or submit a project request
(really, it's not that different, since everything is read by a human)

* You can send an email to scicomp at aalto.fi.
* You can come to our :doc:`daily garage </help/garage>`.
* At the bottom of this page are some email templates you can copy to
  make sure you provide the main information we need.
