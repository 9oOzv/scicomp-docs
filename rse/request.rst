Requesting RSE support
======================

You can contact us regardless of how small your issue is - or even if
you would like to know if we could help your project.  At least, we
can point you in the right direction.



Quick Consultations
-------------------

We recommend you come to our daily :ref:`garage sessions
<scicomp-garage>` for a short chat.  There are no reservations, and
this is the online equivalent of dropping by our office to say hi.



Contact
-------

Our email is rse-group@aalto.fi (the Triton email address
scicomp@aalto.fi also gets to us).  Let us know what is going on, and
we will find a good time to meet.

You can also use the `structured request
form <https://selfservice.esupport.aalto.fi/ssc/app#/order/2026/>`__
("Research Software Engineer request").  This guides you through some
of our initial questions, but goes to the same place as email and
everything is read by a human anyway.
