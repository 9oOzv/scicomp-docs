Research Software Engineers
===========================

In 2020, Aalto Scientific Computing is beginning a Research Software/Data
Engineer (RSE) program to improve the quality of our scientific
computing and data use.  "`Research software engineer <rse-history_>`_" is a recent
term for a longstanding role: someone that works at the interface of
research and software development, but not fully either.  We think
this applies equally to data.

The RSE service provides you with a dedicated person to assist you
with computing, software, and data tasks in your research, for a longer
period than basic staff.  Funding either comes from departments (for
basic service) or the project itself.

As a **researcher**, the RSE service will allow you to focus on what
you want, the science, increase your impact by making your
research outputs more reusable, open, and higher quality.  As a
department, the RSE service will have an immense impact on our
internal productivity.

It's easy to request help, anywhere from an personal consultation, to
group seminar and getting started session, to work on a longer-term
project.  Read more below.

.. note::

   If you are in Aalto, please take `our survey

   (necessary to secure funding) and/or request a consultation.

This is the hands-on compliment our training programs, mainly
:doc:`scientific computing in practice sessions </training/scip/index>` and
`CodeRefinery <https://coderefinery.org>`_.  If you want a kickstart
to put those sessons in practice, this is for you.  Attendance
in these courses is useful but by no means required.
