Research Software Engineers
===========================

Our `Research Software Engineer <rse-history_>`_ (RSE) service provides you with a
dedicated specialist to assist you
with computing, software, and data tasks in your research, for a longer
period than other staff can.  Funding either comes from departments (for
basic service) or from a research project.

As a **researcher**, the RSE service will allow you to focus on what
you want, the science, increase your impact by making your
research outputs more reusable, open, and higher quality.  As a
department, the RSE service will have an immense impact on our
internal productivity.

It's easy to request help, anywhere from an personal consultation, to
group seminar and getting you on the right path, to work on a
longer-term project.  Read more below.

This is the hands-on compliment our training programs, mainly
:doc:`scientific computing in practice sessions </training/scip/index>` and
`CodeRefinery <https://coderefinery.org>`_.  If you want a kickstart
to put those sessons in practice, this is for you.  Attendance
in these courses is useful but by no means required.
