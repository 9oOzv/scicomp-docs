Research Software Engineers
===========================

In 2020, Aalto Scientific Computing is trialing a Research Software/Data
Engineer (RSE) program to improve the quality of our scientific
computing and data use.  "`Research software engineer <rse-def_>`_" is a recent
term for a longstanding role: someone that works at the interface of
research and software development, but not fully either.  We think
this applies equally to data.

.. _rse-def: https://rse.ac.uk/who/

Use of RSEs in research will increase our impact by making our
software more reusable, open, and higher quality.  It will also have
an immense impact on our internal productivity.

Research groups can pay for a dedicated service to suit their needs,
and a basic service is provided for departments to increase the
overall productivity and skills of their staff.

.. note::

   If you are in Aalto, please take `our survey
   <https://forms.gle/wxnCpCGxdUfGGqfw6>`_ to express interest
   (necessary to secure funding) and/or request a consultation.

**This program is currently being developed, and information here may
be updated.**

This is the hands-on compliment our training programs, mainly
:doc:`scientific computing in practice sessions </training/scip/index>` and
`CodeRefinery <https://coderefinery.org>`_.  If you want a kickstart
to put those sessons in practice, this is for you.  Attendance
in these courses is useful but by no means required.




Implementation
--------------

(draft)

Basic services:

* Researchers are selected based on an light application and
  consultation or recommendation from Science-IT.  The RSE program
  balances its time in proportion to its funding from
  schools/departments/groups.

* Ranking criteria includes potential to create lasting improvement of
  skills within a research group, improvement in hardware efficiency,
  number of people benefited, buy-in of group leader, open nature of
  projects (we have a preference for open projects which can serve as
  an example to others), potential for high-impact open software, and
  diversity considerations.

* Typical time frame is generally between one day and a week.

* General timeframe: initial consultation to discuss starting point,
  discussion to decide on target state, RSE provides advice on
  additional training, co-working on the project, follow-up advice as
  needed.  RSE will ideally work from the same office as the
  researcher.


Dedicated service:

* All parameters as agreed in funding discussions.

* Can be implemented as co-funding of salaries or usage fees.

* Time frame typically months or more.  Can include long-term
  maintenance or support at a small full-time equivalent.
