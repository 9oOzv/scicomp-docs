For researchers
===============

You program or analyze data in your daily work, and you know something is missing:
your code and data is less organized, less efficient, less managed than others,
and it's affecting the quality of your work.  Or maybe you don't know
how to start your project, or publish it.  You're too busy with the
science to have time to focus on the computing.



Basic service
-------------

**Basic service:** You can apply to the Research Software/Data Engineer
(RSE) program for support and mentorship.  One of our trained RSEs
will work with you for a short period to begin or improve your
project.  The goal is not just to do it for you, but to show you by
example so that you can do it yourself later.  Typical basic tasks
include:

* Setting up a project in version control with all the features.  This
  also includes version control of data.
* Preparing code or data for release and publication
* Creating or automating a workflow, especially those processing data
  or running simulations
* Optimizing some code - both for speed and/or adaptability
* Efficiency storing data for intensive analysis.  Data replication
  and management.
* Making existing software more modular and reusable
* Help properly using, for example, machine learning library
  pipelines, instead of hacking things together yourself
* Setting up automatic software testing
* Transforming projects from individual to collaborative - either
  within a group, or open source.
* Generalized "code clean-up" which takes a project from development
  to stabilized

Dedicated service
-----------------
  
**Dedicated service:** Our RSEs may also provide
programming-as-a-service for specific projects.  Normally, this would
be for larger projects which need long-term support and maintenance,
including those which just want a service and not necessarily to learn
how to do it themselves.  As part of this service, one can get:

* Developing or maintaining specific software, services, demos, or
  implementations.
* Software development as a service
* Software support that lasts beyond the time frame of a single
  student's attention
* Adding features to existing software
