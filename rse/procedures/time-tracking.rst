Time tracking
=============

.. warning::

   This page is still in draft form and being discussed and
   developed - it is *only a proposal*.  See the note on the parent
   page.

   This proposal may turn out to be especially bad... please comment.

Unfortunately (fortunately?), we have to track our time some, in order
to justify the benefits of what we do.



Finance time tracking
---------------------

For projects funded by groups (external or internal funding), they
should me marked in Halli.  All other projects (funded by the
department's/school's basic funding) is marked to the standard RSE
project (ask for it), and this time is accounted for at the end of
each year (using the system below)



Internal time tracking
----------------------

In addition to the financial tracking above, it seems we have to keep
a separate tracking of what projects we work on because not every
project is reportable via Halli.

Right now we propose that time tracking is done through Gitlab, within
the issue opened for each "project".

Gitlab commands:

* Use these within the issue as a comment, to control the time
  allocation.
* ``/estimate NNw`` - estimate total time a project make take.  Used as
  soon as possible at beginning of a project, can always be updated
* ``/spend NNh`` - announce that you have spent a certain amount of time
  on the project
* Units: Months (``mo``), Weeks (``w``), Days (``d``), Hours (``h``), Minutes
  (``m``). Default conversion rates are 1mo = 4w, 1w = 5d, and 1d = 8h.
* Use the labels to record the sponsoring department, funding source
  (project or basic), and state.


Other notes
-----------

Be aware:

* Be aware that it takes some time to get up to speed with a project.
  This should be considered when making the initial estimate, during
  the first consultation.
* When being paid by projects, we need to *only* record time actually
  spent on that project.  Thus, daily garages and other RSE meetings
  need to recorded to the common RSE project/cost center.  These
  overhead work times are managed separately.
