Time tracking
=============

.. warning::

   This page is still in draft form and being discussed and
   developed.  See the note on the parent page.

   This draft may turn out to be especially bad... please comment.

Unfortunately (fortunately?), we have to track our time some, in order
to justify the benefits of what we do.

Time tracking is done through Gitlab, within the issue opened for each
"project".

Gitlab commands:

* Use these within the issue as a comment, to control the time
  allocation.
* ``/estimate NNw`` - estimate total time a project make take.  Used as
  soon as possible at beginning of a project, can always be updated
* ``/spend NNh`` - announce that you have spent a certain amount of time
  on the project
* Units: Months (``mo``), Weeks (``w``), Days (``d``), Hours (``h``), Minutes
  (``m``). Default conversion rates are 1mo = 4w, 1w = 5d, and 1d = 8h.


Be aware:

* Be aware that it takes some time to get up to speed with a project.
  This should be considered when making the initial estimate, during
  the first consultation.
* No one can work at 100% at a specific task.  Instead of
  micro-managing time, our RSE should assume 75% efficiency for the
  time billed to any given project, with the rest for overhead tasks.
  This also covers the time spent by other SciComp members spending
  consulting on projects, and time spent after the project is done
  with follow-up consultations.
