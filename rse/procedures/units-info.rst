Unit information
================

This page describes the Aalto units which are supporting the RSE
program and what their priorities are.



General questions
-----------------

A unit joining and providing funding should first check the
:doc:`implementation plan <implementation>` and then consider the
following questions:

- Maintain some fraction of time for basic services (short term,
  free-at-point-of-use assistance to strategically improve the quality
  of your research) ←→ or prioritize projects that can pay themselves
  to make the unit's cost as low as possible.

- Support the coolest projects ←→ help those who are struggling the
  most.

- Support efficient use of infrastructure/hardware or existing project
  ←→ new projects.

- Are there any strategic areas to focus on?

- Contact us for a personalized chat about possibilities.



Units
-----

The following units are currently supporting the RSE program, so only
these units may receive the "basic service" (short term help, free to
the user).  Others *may* be able to purchase our services using their
own project funding, depending on how much time we have available.
