Unit information
================

This page describes the Aalto units which are supporting the RSE
program and what their priorities are.

The service is currently (late 2022) mainly funded by the School of
Science, so our focus must be there.  In early 2022, this service was free
for everyone at Aalto thanks to a pilot grant from Aalto IT Services.
This was successful and we are waiting for the next phase in 2022.

See :doc:`../units` if you would like to join the RSE service as a
department or school.

Rest of Aalto
-------------
In early 2022, we had a pilot project from IT Services to provide this
service to all of Aalto.  It was successful and we are waiting for the
next steps, but as of late 2022, we can't focus on non-SCI projects.
Go ahead and drop by and we can add you to our queue.

If you project has its own funding, we *can* support it.  And the
:doc:`/help/garage` support is always available.
