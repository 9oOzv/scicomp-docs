Unit information
================

This page describes the Aalto units which are supporting the RSE
program and what their priorities are.



General questions
-----------------

A unit joining and providing funding should first check the
:doc:`implementation plan <implementation>` and then consider the
following questions:

- Do you want your monetary share to be reduced to zero (by accept
  project funds wherever possible) ←→ or maintain some fraction of
  time for basic services (short term, free-at-point-of-use assistance
  to strategically improve the quality of your research).

- Support the coolest projects ←→ help those who are struggling the
  most.

- Contact us for a personalized chat about possibilities.



Units
-----

The following units are currently supporting the RSE program, so only
these units may receive the "basic service" (short term help, free to
the user).  Others *may* be able to purchase our services using their
own project funding, depending on how much time we have available.
