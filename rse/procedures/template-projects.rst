Template projects
=================

This page lists representative example projects which can be used as
templates for other projects.  For example: copy-paste Github Action
for releasing a Python package to PyPI.

Requirements:

- The best demonstration of something(s) which others are likely to
  need to reproduce in other projects (make it clear what those things
  are - not everything needs to be perfect).
- Try to make it clear if it's an overall template project, or has one
  part that is the best demonstration that should be copied.
- License which allows unlimited copying (CC-0 for the template parts
  recommended, though not required for the whole project).
