Project management
==================

.. note::

   This page is still a working document, discuss anything that
   appears like it should be improved.

Unfortunately (fortunately?), we need to track where our time goes in order
to justify the benefits of what we do.  There are two main uses of the
data:

1) General reporting: being able to say how our time is distributed
   among departments and projects.  This doesn't have to be perfectly
   accurate (and since we have so many small projects, it would be a
   big waste of time to try to be perfect) - but it should be
   asymptotically correct.  This is tracked in Gitlab.

2) Financial reporting and project payments.  This needs to be
   accurate, but only for the few projects which have special
   funding.  The master data is in financial systems, but Gitlab can
   be used to make this reporting a bit easier.


Typical project flow
--------------------

* Someone will contact us somehow.  We try to get them to the garage
  or a real chat as soon as possible.

* Initial discussion.  If it seems this should be a tracked project,
  then make the issue


Finance time tracking
---------------------

For projects with their own funding (external or internal funding),
you should get instructions about how to use them.  One thing may be
marking them in Halli.  All other projects (funded by the
department's/school's basic funding) is marked to the standard RSE
project (ask for it), and this time is accounted for at the end of
each year (using internal corrections).



Internal tracking
-----------------

(This section is for our RSEs)

GitLab is used to track all projects and time we spend on them.
Projects have labels that describe them, there are some Gitlab
commands, and there are custom commands.

* Be aware that it takes some time to get up to speed with a project.
  This should be considered when making the initial estimate, during
  the first consultation.  When recording time spent, include the time
  it takes to get up to speed and learn whatever else is needed for
  the project.

* When being paid by projects (in the Finance systems), we need to
  *only* record time actually
  spent on that project.  Thus, the rest of your time should still be
  recorded to the common RSE project in the finance system.


Day-to-day procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See `the rse-timetracking repository
<https://github.com/AaltoRSE/rse-timetracking>`__ for info on how to use
Gitlab.  But the actual data is in **rse-projects**.


Gitlab commands and project metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The full documentation of the GitLab commands is in the
rse-timetracking project readme:
