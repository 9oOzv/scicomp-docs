Aalto RSE procedures
====================

.. warning::

   This section is still under discussion and construction.  Nothing
   is here is final, out of principle we are developing it in openly
   so that we can get feedback and iterate together.  If you want to
   use this service and don't like something here, don't be
   discouraged: suggest what you would like instead.  Open an issue or
   pull request or contact us to discuss.

   The how-to-request us methods are not live yet, so contact us at
   scicomp at aalto.fi instead.


This contains internal procedures about how we run our RSE program.
Some stuff is for our users, some is for honw we work internally (but
open out of principle)
