RSE community
=============

Do you like coding, research, and the academic environment, but want
slightly more emphasis and community around the software side?  Join
the Aalto RSE community even from your current position.  There are no
requirements, just networking and development.  This is also a
":doc:`Triton </triton/index>` powerusers group".

RSEs have been an essential part of science for ages, are but hardy ever
recognised.  We have many here at Aalto.  Aalto SciComp is trying to
make a community of these people.  By taking part, you can:

* Network with others in similar situations and discover career
  opportunities.

* Share knowledge among ourselves (maybe have relevant training, too)

* Take part in developing our services - basically, be a voice of the
  users.

* More directly help the community by, for example, :doc:`directly updating
  this site </README>`, helping to develop services, or teaching with us.



Aalto community chats
---------------------

We have biweekly chats for the Aalto RSE/scientific computing
poweruser meetings.  This is a way to network with similarly-minded
people.  Check back for updates on when these are.
