Already an (underground) RSE at Aalto?
--------------------------------------

RSEs have been an essential part of science for ages, but hardy ever
recognised.  We have many here at Aalto.  Aalto SciComp is trying to
make a community of these people.  By taking part, you can

* Network with others in similar situations and discover career
  opportunities.

* Share knowledge among ourselves (maybe have relevant training, too)

* Take part in developing our services - basically, be a voice of the
  users.

* More directly help the community by, for example, directly updating
  this site, helping to develop services, or teaching with us.

Join `our RSE mailing list
<https://list.aalto.fi/mailman/listinfo/rse>`_ to be kept up to date.
