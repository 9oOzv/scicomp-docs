2022 Aalto RSE report
=====================

..
  What people want to know:
  - Is it successful?
  - What is the funding?
  - What is the future?

.. admonition:: Summary

   * The Research Software Engineering service allows researchers to
     take on more ambitious projects and existing projects to be much
     faster and higher quality.
   * There is no shortage of RSE projects, we could get more if we did
     more outreach (which we don't since we would then be
     over-capacity).
   * We finish most projects too quickly to make project funding worth
     the effort, but there is a steady stream of longer-term project
     proposals which offer funding.
   * We ask for

     * Help in finding the researchers and projects who can most
       benefit by this service.
     * We could probably connect to societal impact better.



Plenty of projects and still expanding
--------------------------------------

.. admonition:: Summary

   * About 100 projects in a bit less than two years.
   * Countless "garage projects": short help sessions to keep work
     flowing smoothly.
   * Perhaps 5× return on time spent (time we spent vs time
     researchers save).
   * We have gotten pilot funding to expand beyond SCI and there is
     active interest here.

History of Aalto RSE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- December 2018: Idea ("Computational support scholar" postdoc-type
  position)
- December 2019: initial funding from SCI
- October 2020: first hires (permanent)
- Now: three permanent full time staff, continuous stream of
  projects.

Current staff and jobs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are part of Science-IT:

- Three full-time RSEs
- Two other staff with funding from specific projects
- One staff leading
- Three other staff fit "we are all RSEs anyway"

Types of projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **No shortage of projects, also not yet over our limit.**

  - **We don't advertise too much, since that would take us over our
    limit.**

  - Thus, there is definitely capacity to expand.

Projects fit into two main categories:

- **RSE projects**, take hours to months, in our issue tracker,
  long-term support.

  - The "classic work" of an RSE.

- **Garage projects** are small questions that come up in the "daily
  garage"

  - Garage is our daily support method, answering small questions.

Project stats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* 101 researcher projects in ~ 1.75 years.
* **Overall "researcher time saved" is generally 5× "RSE time spent"**
  (self-reports from customers)

.. figure:: 2022-projects-time-by-department.png

   Time spent by department.  Not all time is recorded.  Figure
   includes only full-time RSE time spent.  Note that we have other
   funding sources that allow us to work outside of SCI, and that
   Science-IT receives general funding to serve the whole university.

.. figure:: 2022-projects-time-needed-by-task.png

   Time estimate (past and present) by type of tasks of all recorded
   projects, including future projects, leads, and canceled ideas.
   Projects have multiple tasks/benefits and all time is included in
   *all tasks* in this figure.  **Values should only be used as a
   relative comparison.**

Garage stats
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- From October 2020 -- August 2022, about 500 visitors logged (about
  half of visits are recorded).
- Average visit from 30-60 minutes of support.
- Most are answering tech/software questions to help research, and
  teach people to be self-sufficient.

.. figure:: 2022-garage-customers-departments.png

   Garage customers by department, 2020-2022.  Note that old garage
   data is extremely sparse, so this is more of a current estimate.

.. figure:: 2022-garage-customers.png

   Garage customers by title.  We only recently began collecting this
   data, so it is very incomplete but roughly representative.  We only
   support researchers and staff, students not doing research are
   directed to student resources.



Future funding status
---------------------

.. admonition:: Summary

   * Current level of basic funding should continue, future expansion
     via dedicated project funding.
   * We have trouble accepting payments from projects.

     * Most projects are too small to make a payment worth the
       administrative effort. (< 1 month, which Finance proposed as a
       limit of worth it).
     * Microtransactions for payment aren't a good idea anyway.
     * A fair number of projects (~10-20) have written months of work
       into submitted grants, funded us, or offered funding.

   * To make project funding really work well, we need a
     high-level-management thinking about this type of funding.


Financial transaction difficulty
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Original plan: try to get most funding from grants.
- Finance (for very good reasons) doesn't want to do small
  transactions - minimum 1 month.
- Academy/EU rules don't allow easy invoicing, so must pay salary
  directly.

Current project funding policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Each research group gets ~1 month of free RSE time, funded from
  basic funding.
- After that, a group is expected to provide project funding.
- We finish most projects in less than a month, though.

Future funding plan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ~2 FTE of basic funding seems reasonable (could be increased)
- Expansion beyond that via project funding (with SCI funding as
  buffer between these periods)


Funding from other schools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- IT Services has provided pilot funding to expand to other schools.
- We expect future (funded) expansion to other schools.



Future hopes
------------

.. admonition:: Summary

   I recommend you read the points, but the summary is that that we
   think the next few years can focus on refining the type of impact
   we have: we reach the cases where our impact is obvious, but what
   about all the other cases?  We should transform how research is
   done and how it is consumed.

Wanted: Better outreach and impact
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* There is no shortage of projects, and advertising more will surely
  fill us up.
* Yet there are some things we can improve in the future.

Reach those who need it the most
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Many people find us by word of mouth
* Do we get the customers who need us most?

Connect to societal impact measures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Open science, reusable software, published data are more important
  now.  We have time to do this right.
* Example: web interfaces for algorithms and data.
* Is it used in reportables as much as it could be?

Expansion to other schools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* We expect this service to expand to other schools and universities
  in the future.
* This will allow a broader knowledge base from which any individual
  project can draw.
