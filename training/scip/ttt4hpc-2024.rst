Tuesday Tools & Techniques for High Performance Computing
=========================================================

.. figure:: img/ttt4hpc.png


Do you use supercomputers in your research work? Are you curious about 
making your computing faster and more efficient? Join us for TTT4HPC: 
four self-contained episodes on best practices in High Performance Computing. 
This is a great chance to enhance your computational skills. What you will learn 
is also used a lot outside academia whenever large scale computations are needed.

The course happens online. Mornings (2h) lectures via TwitchTV. Afternoons (1.5h) hands-on exercises on zoom with our HPC experts. 

Here below you find the list of episodes and how to register. Episodes are self-contained,
you can join only for the episodes that are useful for your research.

Prerequisites
-------------
You won't be able to engange with the exercises and examples of the course if you don't have access to an HPC cluster. Usually employers from higher education institutions can always request access to HPC resources. If you are unsure, please get in touch with your local support. Being familiar with basics tools used with HPC and remote computing is fundamental for this course. Familiarize yourself with the Linux command line. You should be familiar with basics concepts and rules of HPC systems. You can watch our past training on "`Introduction to HPC (aka kickstart) <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dThyrEXfAbM&list=PLZLVmS9rf3nMKR2jMglaN4su3ojWtWMVw>`__"
