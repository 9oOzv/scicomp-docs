Oct 2020 / Data analysis workflows with R and Python
====================================================

Part of the `Scientific Computing in Practice <https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/scip/index.html>`__ lecture series at Aalto University.

**Audience:** Researchers who are using or will soon be using R and Python
for data analysis, who know how to program with these languages, but do not
necessarily know what are the best practices for data analysis.
The course material is available in both R and Python, but this
is not a course on the basics of scientific programming. If you wish to
prep up your scientific programming skills, we recommend taking
our :doc:`../scip/python-for-scicomp`-course.

**About the course:** We provide a practical introduction and advice
for data analysis in R and Python. We will learn how you should organize
your workflow, how to organize your data for efficient data analysis, how
to obtain statistics and fit models into your data, and how to think about
scaling your workflow.

The course is suited for people who are starting on doing data analysis
and would like to start on a good workflow.

The exercises can be done with either R or Python.

Course consists of four three hour sessions that will be done online
via zoom. In these sessions we'll learn of core concepts of data analysis.
We will do exercises during the sessions (available via course's
`GitHub repository <https://github.com/AaltoSciComp/data-analysis-workflows-course/>`_).

**Lecturer:** Simo Tuomisto, M. Sc., Aalto Scientific Computing / Department of Computer
Science

- **Please connect to all sessions 10 minutes early:** icebreakers and intro
  already starts then.

**Place:**
This is an online course via Zoom (link sent to registered
participants).  The course is also streamed via Twitch (the
`CodeRefinery channel <https://www.twitch.tv/coderefinery>`__) so that
anyone may follow along without registration.  There is a HackMD link
(collaborative edited notes), which is used for asking questions during
the course.  The `actual material is here
<https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/data-analysis-workflows-course/>`__.

**Cost:** Free of charge for FGCI consortium members including Aalto
employees and students.

**Registration:** `registration is open <https://link.webropolsurveys.com/S/9F2A504AF3088DBD>`__

**Credits:** Credits available for the Aalto students and course
certificate can be provided on request for the outsiders. Full course
hours correspond roughly to 1 ECTS. Students who wish to get a
certificate should hand in the special assignment and participate to
at least 3 of 4 lectures.
