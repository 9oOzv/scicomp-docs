Your future career in scientific computing
==========================================

This course is the starting point.  What comes next?



Don't go alone
--------------

* There is too much for anyone to learn directly
* Form networks with your colleagues, help and learn from each other.
* Academic courses teach you theory, but usually are not teaching
  complexities of applying it in practice.



Help
----

* Aalto: https://scicomp.aalto.fi/help/

  * More on this later.

* Aalto: daily garage: https://scicomp.aalto.fi/help/garage/

  * Ask us any question about Triton or scientific computing.

* AaltoSciComp chat: https://scicomp.aalto.fi/help/chat/

  * Chat is not good for long questions; we may direct you to the
    issue tracker.
  * But it is great for "does anyone else have this problem"
  * Please help each other

* Usergroups

  * In the future, we want to form user groups
  * We have very little time to organize this, if someone else helps,
    that would be great.




Training
--------

There are lots of other courses to take.

* Coderefinery: https://coderefinery.org

  * Intensive workshop in tools you need to do scientific computing.
  * Version control (git), testing, modular code, etc.
  * Not about programming, but what you need to do
    programming/scripting/data analysis well.

* Research software hour: https://researchsoftwarehour.github.io

  * "Web show" on assorted topics related to scientific computing
  * Informal and unplanned

* Hands-on Scientific Computing: https://handsonscicomp.readthedocs.io

  * Online course (more like a roadmap) of the most important untaught
    skills.
  * Get one or two credits.



Professional development
------------------------

* Do you really like the computing aspect?  Maybe you consider
  yourself a "Research Software Engineer"
* Nordic-RSE (https://nordic-rse.org) and Aalto RSE (https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/)


Aalto Research Software Engineer service
----------------------------------------

* Do you really not want to spend your time on making it run on a
  cluster? That's fine.
* Do you want someone to help you with porting, optimizing, or
  releasing software?
* The **Aalto Research Software Engineer service** can help!

  * You can focus on your work and get professional support for
    implementing these computing tasks.

  * Currently available for free in the School of Science.  Status of
    others unknown.
