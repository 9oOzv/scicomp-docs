Summary of videos
=================

Why do we have these video summaries?
-------------------------------------

- There are some important topics that you need to know.
- But we can't teach them every time.
- Modern tech to the rescue!  We teach them occasionally and you can
  watch at your own pace.
- Still, we want to summarize them now.




Scientific computing workflows
------------------------------

Why workflows?

There are many ways to do your work, from

- Your own laptop
- Remote desktop system
- Remote server
- Cluster computing

All of these have their own role.

- Days 2-3 are about the cluster computing.
- But many people don't need to go so far
- Or start off and it becomes difficult to go further.



Plan for the future
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- It is good to start small when developing.

- Eventually you need:

  - More computing power for a single task
  - To do it automatically, over and over again.

- Then, you need to be able to move up this "computing ladder"



Where to go next?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Each university hopefully has some guide to these levels
- Don't get locked into clicking buttons
- Slowly move up as you need



Basic Linux shell and scripting

- Like we said above, sometimes you need to do things over and over
  again.
- Clicking buttons is *not* scaleable.
- The command line is the standard way of doing this.



What's the command line?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Current interface developed as part of UNIX in 1960-70s, now used by
  almost everything.



Typical uses
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Making a reusable program
- Separating parameters from code
- Connecting different programs together
- Automating things for yourself
- Automating things for the cluster
