Summer Kickstart intro
======================



What is this course?
--------------------


Course contents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Day 1

  * General big-picture stuff
  * Some practical skills and stuff

* Days 2 and 3

  * Using the cluster
  * Lessons will also be useful before you need a cluster.


Who is attending?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Multiple universities, with *different clusters*
* Our demos based on Aalto University

  * May need adapting to other sites


Who are we?
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Aalto Scientific Computing: https://scicomp.aalto.fi/about/
* In collaborations with other universities
* And in collaboration with CSC


Not everything will be perfect
------------------------------

- We have more material than we can cover: we adjust to the audience.
- Our material is constantly being improved



Practicalities
--------------


How the workshop works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When some people teach online, they can reach a few tens of people at
once.  We can reach hundreds.

We have an interesting strategy:

- "TV production", broadcast via livestream.
- Anyone can watch.
- If you want, be in Zoom and switch there for exercise sessions.

There are many parts of the workshop:

- Talking and demos (livestream)
- Type-along (livesteam)
- Exercises (Zoom)
- Breaks, at least 10 minutes/hour

There is a **lot** of material, and everyone will take a slightly
different path.  This is OK!


Chat and communication
----------------------

- Please don't use the Zoom chat for questions: who can keep track?

  - Instructors won't see
  - But you can for practical questions

- Use HackMD for chat: questions in bullet points:

     :alt: View and edit modes at top

- From here you can also find important links and reference.

- You can switch between view and edit modes:

     :alt: View and edit modes at top

  - You have to switch to edit mode once to get live updates (then you
    can go back to view)
  - Please leave in view mode if you aren't actively using it

- Someone watches these and will answer or raise relevant questions by
  voice.

- Don't get overloaded!  The point is you can read later.

- **Don't include names or identifies in HackMD: it is public.**

**Icebreaker: Please answer the icebreaker question in HackMD**


Where do you focus?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is so much information!  What should we look?

- **Screenshare and lecture**
- **Your own type-along**
- **HackMD (all important links should be pasted here)**

  - Only look at the bottom.
  - Come back and read detailed answers later, not during.

- Lesson webpage (as needed, direct links in HackMD)


Screen arrangement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Arranging your screen is surprisingly difficult!

- We share a vertical window, so half of the screen is for us, and
  half is for demos.
- Zoom "Dual monitor mode" (in the settings) gives you two *windows*
  which might be useful.

Care for the community
----------------------

Be respectful and helpful
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is actually hard to teach and mentor for tech like this.  We need
everyone to take part in this process.

We leave you with four pieces of advice for now:

- **Everyone here is at different levels, and that's expected.**
  Everyone will be learning different things, and everyone will focus
  on different topics.  Passive learning is OK.
- ***Everyone* here is both a teacher and a learner.**  Be careful
  that your help is at the right level, considering the above.
- **Take time to check in.** For example, ask "how's it going? is
  everyone getting what they need?", in breakout rooms.
- **When something isn't going right, *speak (or HackMD) up quickly***.
  We want to help, even if the answer is "let's discuss later".


Instructors and helpers aren't perfect
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- No one knows everything.
- Seeing things go wrong and get fixed is part of the pedagogy.
- Please be nice to those who make this course possible.


Final notes
-----------

Recording
~~~~~~~~~

- The course is recorded and will be put on YouTube
- But because of the livestream thing, you *can't* be there.
- All outputs are CC-BY.


Credits
~~~~~~~

- We don't assign credits for attending this course - we can't track
  attendance.
- Use what you learn here in the online course Hands-on Scientific
  Computing (https://handsonscicomp.readthedocs.io) to get credits.


Join us!
~~~~~~~~

We are staff at Aalto but welcome others to join us in allowing
everyone to do scientific computing.

- Chat

More on this later.
