Part of :doc:`Scientific Computing in Practice </training/index>` lecture series at Aalto University.

**Audience:** Scientists, researchers, and others looking for an
extensive intro into Linux shell / terminal.  Primary audience is
academics in Finland, outsiders are welcome to register and are
accepted if there is space (there always is space).

**About the course:** The Linux shell lets you work efficiently on
remote computers and automate bigger projects - whether you are
managing a lot of data or running programs on a computer cluster.
Without it, you are often stuck when you need to do move beyond basic
tools like Jupyter notebooks.  This course covers the Bash shell, but
the principles apply to other shells such as zsh.

This course will cover the basics so that you'll know what the shell
is, are comfortable using it for your own projects, and are able to
attend other courses with the shell as a prerequisite.  We'll get
familiar with the command line, files and directories, and other
things you often find in shell environments.  We will
unleash the power of that blinking cursor in the terminal
window. Windows/Mac/Linux users are warmly welcome - regardless of
what you use on your desktop, you'll need this when using more
powerful remote computers.

We will start with somewhat basics like files and processes and go up
to command line magic like redirections and pipes. This should be
enough to get started with the Linux terminal.

There is an advanced part of this course given later in the spring
which will go through scripting and automation in more detail (part 2
in the material).

**Lecturer:** Ivan Tervanto, D. Sc., Science IT / Department of Applied Physics, Aalto University

**Time, date, place:** the course consists of three hands-on sessions (3h each), via Zoom. On-site option is possible if there is enough interest from course participants.

**Credits/certificate:** It is not possible to obtain certificates or credits for this course.

**Required setup:** During the tutorials weâ€™ll use a terminal with a BASH shell, means that either you have a Linux/Mac computer at your place or a Windows PC with the `Git BASH <https://gitforwindows.org/>`__, or VDI to a Linux, or SSH client installed for accessing any of Linux server (kosh/lyta etc at Aalto, we will touch the SSH connection issue on the first session).
