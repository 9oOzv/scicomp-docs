Practical workflows for scientific computing
============================================

In our :doc:`summer HPC kickstart <kickstart-2023>` courses, we
show the basic principles of using a cluster and other computing
tools.  Yet there is still a long way from basic usage to the powerful
workflows that people use in their science.  This course is designed
to fill that gap by showing advanced real-life examples of how people
actually do their science with computers.

This course is expected during academic year 2023-2024 but dates and exact topics
are not yet.  If you are interested in helping out or you have
requests for topics, please :doc:`get in touch </help/index>`.


Topics
------

The format is a series of (mostly) independent demos about the way
people actually work.  Each demo should have a few points which you
can apply to your work - either now or in the future.  You will also
greatly broader your skills.

Example topics include (please suggest more you would like):

- Parallelizing things without parallelizing things (array jobs)
- Version control for small projects - how it's actually used
- Developing on the cluster - or locally?
- Workflow automation
- Configuring simulations to sweep through different parameters.
- How we actually connect to the cluster and work there.
