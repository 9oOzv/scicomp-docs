Workflows
=========

In our :doc:`summer HPC kickstart <kickstart-2022-summer>` courses, we
show the basic principles of using a cluster and other computing
tools.  Yet there is still a long way from basic usage to the powerful
workflows that people use in their science.  This course is designed
to fill that gap by showing advanced real-life examples of how people
actually do their science with computers.

This course is expected in February 2023 but dates and exact topics
are not yet.  If you are interested in helping out or you have
requests for topics, please :doc:`get in touch <help>`.
