**Audience:** FCCI consortium members, students and employees looking for the basic intro into Matlab.

**About the course:**

MATLAB is a high-level technical computing language and interactive environment for algorithm development, data visualization, data analysis and numerical computation in general.  — The Mathworks Inc.

The goal of the course is to introduce the participants to the basics of the MATLAB computing environment, and give some insight into how it can be used in scientific computing. Additionally, topics involving writing efficient MATLAB code, such as vectorization, logical indexing and pre-allocation will be discussed.

Teaching will be interactive, “learning by doing”.
