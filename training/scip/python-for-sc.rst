=================================
Sept 2020 / Python for Scientists
=================================

Part of :doc:`Scientific Computing in Practice <index>` lecture series
at Aalto University.

This is a medium-advanced course in Python tools such as NumPy, SciPy,
Matplotlib, and Pandas.  It is suitable for people who have a basic
understanding of basic Python and want to know some internals and
important libraries for science.

Prerequisites include basic programming in Python.



Practical information
---------------------

This is an online course via Zoom, which will also be streamed via
Twitch so that anyone may follow along without registration.

**Lecturer:** Richard Darst, PhD, Aalto Scientific Computing

**Time, date, place:** the course consists of four online hands-on
sessions 3h each:

- Mon 14.9, 10:00-13:00
- Wed 16.9, 10:00-13:00
- Mon 21.9, 10:00-13:00
- Wed 23.9, 10:00-13:00

**Registration:** This is on online workshop: we currently plan for
registrations via Zoom up to our capicity (for lectures+exercises,
priority for Aalto→Finland→Nordics), or Twitch (lectures, for anyone).
`Registration for announcements and Zoom session
<https://link.webropolsurveys.com/S/9DF02396D725FA71>`__.

You may register as a **team**, and your team will be kept together
during exercise sessions within a breakout room.  If you come together
with your friends or research group, you will be able to learn a lot
more.  Even more so if you bring a helper with your group.

**Credits:** Certificates are not provided for this course.

Preparation
-----------

Prerequisites include basic programming in Python (at any level).

**Preparation:** Online workshops can be a productive format, but it
takes some effort to get ready.  Browse these resources:

* `Attending an online workshop
  <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/how-to-attend-online/>`__,
  good to read in detail (ignore the CodeRefinery-specific parts).
* `How to use HackMD to take answer questions and hold discussions <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/hackmd-mechanics/>`__.
* `The Zoom mechanics we will use
  <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/zoom-mechanics/>`__, might
  be useful to browse.
* It is useful to `watch <https://youtu.be/56p6xX0aToI>`__ or `read
  <https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/shell/>`__ the Linux shell crash
  course, since these basic command line concepts are always useful.

Software installation:

* Software requirements will be updated here later.
* `Zoom <https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/zoom/>`__
