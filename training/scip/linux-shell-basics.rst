==============================
Sept 2019 / Linux Shell Basics
==============================

Part of `Scientific Computing in Practice <https://scicomp.aalto.fi/traning/scip/>`__ lecture series at Aalto University.

**Audience:** employees and students looking for an extensive intro into Linux shell / terminal.

**About the course:** Linux shell is what you get when you open a terminal. This course we cover all the basics that we will need later on for most part of the courses given this fall/spring. It is oriented on Linux new comers, those Windows/Mac users for whom terminal window is a black box rather than a door to the real computing.

We will start with somewhat basics like files and processes and go up to command line magic like redirections and pipes. This should be enough to get started with the Linux terminal.

**Lecturer:** Ivan Degtyarenko, D. Sc., Science IT / Department of Applied Physics, Aalto University
