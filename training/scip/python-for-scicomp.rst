=================================
Sept 2020 / Python for Scientists
=================================

Part of :doc:`Scientific Computing in Practice <index>` lecture series
at Aalto University.

This is a medium-advanced course in Python tools such as NumPy, SciPy,
Matplotlib, and Pandas.  It is suitable for people who have a basic
understanding of basic Python and want to know some internals and
important libraries for science.  Read the `learner personas <https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/#learner-personas>`__ to
see if the course is right for you

`Prerequisites
<https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/#prerequisites>`__
include basic programming in Python.



Practical information
---------------------

This is an online course via Zoom (link sent to registered
participants).  The course is also streamed via Twitch (the
`CodeRefinery channel <https://www.twitch.tv/coderefinery>`__) so that
anyone may follow along without registration.  There is a HackMD link
(collaborative edited notes) which is used for asking questions during
the course.  The `actual material is here
<https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/>`__.

**Lecturer:** Richard Darst, PhD, Aalto Scientific Computing

**Time, date, place:** the course consists of four online hands-on
sessions 3h each:

- Fri 11.sep, 15:30-16:30 **Installation help session**
- Mon 14.sep, 10:00-13:00 (Jupyter, numpy, matplotlib)
- Wed 16.sep, 10:00-13:00 (scripts, packaging)
- Mon 21.sep, 10:00-13:00 (scipy, pandas)
- Wed 23.sep, 10:00-13:00 (library ecosystem, dependencies, Binder)
- **Please connect to all sessions 10 minutes early**: icebreakers and
  intro already starts then.

**Registration:** This is on online workshop: we currently plan for
registrations via Zoom up to our capicity (for lectures+exercises,
priority for Aalto→Finland→Nordics), or Twitch (lectures, for anyone).
`Registration for announcements and Zoom session
<https://link.webropolsurveys.com/S/9DF02396D725FA71>`__.

You may register as a **team**, and your team will be kept together
during exercise sessions within a breakout room.  If you come together
with your friends or research group, you will be able to learn a lot
more.  Even more so if you bring a helper with your group.

**Credits:** Certificates are not provided for this course.

Preparation
-----------

`Prerequisites include basic programming in Python
<https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/#prerequisites>`__.

**Preparation:** Online workshops can be a productive format, but it
takes some effort to get ready.  Browse these resources:

* `Attending an online workshop
  <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/how-to-attend-online/>`__,
  good to read in detail (ignore the CodeRefinery-specific parts).
* `How to use HackMD to take answer questions and hold discussions <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/hackmd-mechanics/>`__.
* `The Zoom mechanics we will use
  <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/zoom-mechanics/>`__, might
  be useful to browse.
* It is useful to `watch <https://youtu.be/56p6xX0aToI>`__ or `read
  <https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/shell/>`__ the Linux shell crash
  course, since these basic command line concepts are always useful.

Software installation:

* See the `installation page of the course material <https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/installation/>`__.
* `Zoom <https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/zoom/>`__.

News and notes
--------------

Week 37:

* Please see the installation instructions (link above).  You need to
  install anaconda *before* the first day, or else you will quickly
  fall behind.  This class is so large that we won't be able to do
  help you catch up.  You should also **verify your installation**
  (this is part of the installation instructions).  On the Friday
  before, we have an installation help session - you can join there
  for help.

* Please remember to join the meeting 10 minutes early.  Our
  icebreakers and introductions already start then.  If you are on
  time, you are late!
