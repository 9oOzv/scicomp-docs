Scientific computing training
=============================

Scientific computing and data science require special, practical
skills in programming and computer use.  However, these aren't often
learned in courses.

This page is your portal for training.  The focus is practical,
hands-on courses for scientists, not theoretical academic courses.  As
a broad classification, we divide the skills a scientist would need
into four big levels A-D:

.. list-table::

   * * **A (basics)**
     * Having a basic knowledge of university resources, so that you use the right tool for the right job and don't lose your data.
   * * **B (scientific computing)**
     * When you are doing science but existing software isn't enough: you have to make your own or connect things together.
   * * **C (high performance computing)**
     * Using large computer clusters for large-scale analysis.  Basically, at Aalto, :doc:`Triton <../triton/index>`.
   * * **D (advanced high performance computing)**
     * Catch-all for everything past level C.
   * * **Special tracks**
     * Programming, scientific papers/posters/presentations, etc.  Can be at any level.

If you're starting research, check this list list above.  What level
of skills do you need?  Ask your advisor, then check the list below to
get to the right level.

A: Basics
=========

There are no dedicated courses for this level, but the page
:doc:`../aalto/welcomeresearchers` is our introduction and has all of
the relevant links to what you need to know. (Course A01)



B: Scientific computing
=======================

Core courses:

.. list-table::

   * * B10

       Basic shell
     * Let's face it: the linux command line is the basis of most data
       science.  `Check out Software Carpentry shell-novice sections 1-3
       <http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/>`__

   * * B14

       Data management
     * If you do the obvious thing, your data will turn into a huge
       mess and you won't be able to work anymore.  This course gives
       some practical hints.  (For now, check out :doc:`the data section <../data/index>`)

   * * B23

       Text editors and IDEs
     * Your best friend is a good text editor.  `Software Carpentry
       shell-novice, part of section 3 <http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/>`__.

   * * B20

       Shell scripting
     * If you can do it on the Linux shell, you can automate it.
       Continue with `Software Carpentry shell-novice above section 4-end
       <http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/>`__

   * * B21

       Version control
     * Version control lets you track changes, go back in time, and
       collaborate on code and papers: an absolute requirement for
       scientific computing.  `CodeRefinery Introduction to version
       control <http://coderefinery.org/lessons/>`__

   * * B22

       SSH and remote access
     * A short but important course: how to do work remotely.
       Different expert tips for making ssh better, too.


Core courses:

.. list-table::

   * * B30

       Makefiles
     * Makefiles are like smart shell scripts.  We learn some about
       them and in the process, become ever more efficient.  `Software
       Carpentry make-novice <http://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice/>`__.

   * * B50

       Advanced version control
     * Previously, you learned only the basics.  Now for the real stuff.

   * * B51

       Jupyter Notebooks
     * Notebooks are an efficient way to make self-documenting code
       and scripts and do data science well.  `CodeRefinery jupyter
       course <http://coderefinery.org/lessons/>`__.

Software development track: Do you do programming?  These courses are
for you.  This does *not* teach you how to program: you need to find
your own course for that, but this will make sure you can do
scientific programming well.

.. list-table::

   * * B60

       Modular code development
     * `CodeRefinery lesson <http://coderefinery.org/lessons/>`__

   * * B61

       Software testing
     * `CodeRefinery lesson <https://coderefinery.github.io/testing/>`__

   * * B62

       Profiling
     * Aalto course

   * * B63

       Debugging
     * Aalto course, for example `course by Janne <https://users.aalto.fi/~jblomqvi/scip/2016/scip-slides/debugging.html>`__

   * * B02

       Software Licensing
     * `CodeRefinery lesson <http://cicero.xyz/v2/remark/github/coderefinery/software-licensing/master/talk.md/>`__

       Parallel programming computers
     * This is an academic course taught in the CS department.  It
       mainly covers OpenMP and CUDA.  Usually taught in 5th period
       (Apr-May), `search MyCourses/Oodi for CS-E4580
       <https://oodi.aalto.fi/a/opintjakstied.jsp?html=1&Kieli=6&Tunniste=CS-E4580>`__.

Also see the `Science-IT training archive
<http://science-it.aalto.fi/scip/>`__ for more level 3 courses.
