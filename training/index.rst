Scientific computing and data science require special, practical
skills in programming and computer use.  However, these aren't often
learned in courses.

This page is your portal for training.  The focus is practical,
hands-on courses for scientists, not theoretical academic courses.
For course announcements at Aalto, see :doc:`the Scientific Computing
in Practice courses page <scip/index>`.

If you're starting research, ask your advisor what level of skill they
expect you to have.  There are both courses and self-study materials
below.  A few hours now can save you days of time during your career.

Skills map
==========

There is a lot to learn, and it all depends on each other.  How do you
get started?

Our training map `Hands-on Scientific Computing
<https://handsonscicomp.readthedocs.io>`__ sorts the skills you need
by level and category, providing you a strategy to get started.

In order to do basic scientific computing, C (Linux and shell) is
needed.  To use a computer cluster, D (Clusters and HPC) is useful  E
(scientific coding) is useful if you are writing your own software.
