==========================
Aalto Scientific Computing
==========================

This contains documentation about scientific, and research computing
at Aalto and beyond.  It is mainly maintained by `Aalto Science-IT
<http://science-it.aalto.fi>`_, who are responsible for scientific
computing at Aalto and running the `Triton <triton/index>` cluster.
Science-IT is organized from the School of Science, but they are (and
these pages are) an Aalto-level infrastructure that supports everyone.
