Scicomp garage
==============

The Aalto Scientific Computing Garage is a hands-on help session for
scientific computing and data-intensive research at Aalto organized by
the Science-IT team (Triton/HPC support).  Other teams, such as CSC,
are sometimes present.  It's the best time to get advice and hands-on
help from the people behind scientific computing at Aalto.  This is a
place to get stuff done, so bring your laptop and coffee/food, and
come hang out.

If you need more help than the issue trackers, this is the place to
be.  It's not just Triton, but all aspects of scientific computing.

Come if you want to:

-  Solve problems
-  Discuss and figure out what your problem really is
-  Brainstorm the best strategy are for your problems
-  Work with someone on your issues in real time
-  Network with others who are doing similar work and learn something
   new

Notes:

* All garages are open to all people (but see the specialities).

* You don't have to have a specific question, you can come by just to
  chat, listen, or figure out if you should have a question.



Online
======

Triton, SciComp and CS
----------------------

You can meet us online, every weekday, at 13:00, `online via zoom
<https://aalto.zoom.us/j/65371910202>`__.  This garage is focused on
**Triton/HPC, scientific computing, data, and CS issues with best
representation by (CS and Science-IT).**  Imagine this like walking
into our office to ask for help.

* **Thursdays** are Triton focus days.  **Fridays** are CS focus
  days.  But you can usually find someone to help any day of the week
  (if not, we'll tell you when to come back).

* This doesn't replace email or the `Triton issue
  tracker
  <https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/AaltoScienceIT/triton/issues>`__
  for clearly-defined tasks.  Garage is good for discussion,
  brainstorming, and deciding the best path.   If in doubt, come to
  garage and we will help you decide.  Many people make an issue, then
  come to garage to discuss.

* Arrive between 13:00 - 13:15.  We leave at 13:15 if there is no one
  around (and the person you need to talk to may leave).  Please don't
  arrive early since we another meeting then.  Program always ends at
  14:00.

* Join on Zoom via https://aalto.zoom.us/j/65371910202 .  If joining
  by web browser, use Chrome.  Audio doesn't work with Firefox or
