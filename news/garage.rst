Scicomp garage
==============

The Aalto Scientific Computing Garage is a hands-on help session for
scientific computing and data-intensive research at Aalto organized by
the Science-IT team (Triton/HPC support).  Other teams, such as CSC,
are sometimes present.  It's the best time to get advice and hands-on
help from the people behind scientific computing at Aalto.  This is a
place to get stuff done, so bring your laptop and coffee/food, and
come hang out.

If you need more help than the issue trackers, this is the place to
be.  It's not just Triton, but all aspects of scientific computing.

Come if you want to:

-  Solve problems
-  Discuss and figure out what your problem really is
-  Brainstorm the best strategy are for your problems
-  Work with someone on your issues in real time
-  Network with others who are doing similar work and learn something
   new

Notes:

* All garages are open to all people (but see the specialities).

* You don't have to have a specific question, you can come by just to
  chat, listen, or figure out if you should have a question.



Online
======

You can meet us online, every weekday, at 13:00, `online via zoom
<https://aalto.zoom.us/j/65371910202>`__.  This garage is focused on
**Triton/HPC, scientific computing, data with best representation by
(CS, NBE, and PHYS).**

.. admonition:: July 2020

   During July, CS and Triton are well represented, and we will try to
   help others as best we can.

* Arrive between 13:00 - 13:15.  We leave at 13:15 if there is no one
  around (and the person you need to talk to may leave).  Please don't
  arrive early since we another meeting then.  Program always ends at
  14:00.

* This is best-effort: if you don't see anyone there by 13:15, we
  couldn't make it so try again the next day.

* We have these special topics on these days of the week:

* Join on Zoom via https://aalto.zoom.us/j/65371910202 .  If joining
  by web browser, use Chrome.  Audio doesn't work with Firefox or
  Safari.

* We will try to greet everyone personally, if we don't get around to
  you then send your topic by chat.

* (Optional) If you want us to prepare, use the the `Triton issue
  tracker
  <https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/AaltoScienceIT/triton/issues>`_,
  make an initial issue, and point out that you want to discuss in the
  garage.  Then, we can easily follow up.
