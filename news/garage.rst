Scicomp garage
==============

Triton Garage is a help session for scientific computing at Aalto
organized by the Science-IT team (Triton admins). There are two things
that can happen: A *short*, *introductory* presentation on some topic
that can get you started, or free form individual help. It's the best
time to talk to the ones behind scientific computing at Aalto.

This is a place to get stuff done, so bring your laptop and coffee/food,
and come hang out.

Come if you want to:

-  Give feedback
-  Solve problems
-  Discuss bigger problems
-  Network with others who are doing similar work
-  Learn something new

Also see our summer HPC kickstart for more in-depth and hands-on
introduction to similar topics.

Schedule
========

-  Days: Triton garage is every week from 13-14 on Wednesdays. Every
   other week, there is a short talk. Otherwise, we are only there for
   questions and support.
-  Time: We promise to be there only the first 30 minutes. After this,
   we leave once we are done helping attendees. So if you are coming,
   come in the first 30 minutes.
-  Location: Presentation weeks (listed below) are as below. Any other
   week is CS building T4.
