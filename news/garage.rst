Scicomp garage
==============

The Aalto Scientific Computing Garage is a hands-on help session for
scientific computing and data-intensive research at Aalto organized by
the Science-IT team (Triton/HPC support).  Other teams, such as CSC,
are sometimes present.  It's the best time to get advice and hands-on
help from the people behind scientific computing at Aalto.  This is a
place to get stuff done, so bring your laptop and coffee/food, and
come hang out.

If you need more help than the issue trackers, this is the place to
be.  It's not just Triton, but all aspects of scientific computing.

Come if you want to:

-  Solve problems
-  Discuss what the best strategy are for your problems
-  Network with others who are doing similar work
-  Learn something new
-  Give feedback
