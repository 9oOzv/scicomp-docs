Scicomp garage
==============

The Aalto Scicomp Garage is a help session for scientific computing at
Aalto organized by the Science-IT team (Triton admins).  It's the best
time to talk to the people behind scientific computing at Aalto.  This
is a place to get stuff done, so bring your laptop and coffee/food,
and come hang out.

Most of the time, we are just there to answer questions.

Sometimes, there may be a short presentation on some topic, but you
can still ask questions to the other staff before, during, and after
that.

Come if you want to:

-  Solve problems
-  Discuss bigger problems
-  Network with others who are doing similar work
-  Learn something new
-  Give feedback

Schedule
========

-  Days: Triton garage is every week from 13:00-14:00 on Thursdays.
-  Time: We promise to be there only the first 30 minutes or so, if
   everyone leaves before then.  Usually we are there the whole time.
-  Location: See below.  U121a_ and U121b_  (in main building),
   T4_ and A106_ (CS building), F254_ (F-building, some may call it "Health
   technology house").  Carefully note the difference between U121a
   and U121b, but they are right by each other.
