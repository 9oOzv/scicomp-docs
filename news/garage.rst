Scicomp garage
==============

The Aalto Scicomp Garage is a help session for scientific computing at
Aalto organized by the Science-IT team (Triton admins).  It's the best
time to talk to the people behind scientific computing at Aalto.  This
is a place to get stuff done, so bring your laptop and coffee/food,
and come hang out.

Most of the time, we are just there to answer questions.

Sometimes, there may be a short presentation on some topic, but you
can still ask questions to the other staff before, during, and after
that.

Come if you want to:

-  Solve problems
-  Discuss bigger problems
-  Network with others who are doing similar work
-  Learn something new
-  Give feedback
