Scicomp garage
==============

The Aalto Scicomp Garage is a help session for scientific computing at
Aalto organized by the Science-IT team (Triton admins).  It's the best
time to talk to the people behind scientific computing at Aalto.  This
is a place to get stuff done, so bring your laptop and coffee/food,
and come hang out.

There are two things that can happen: During the whole time, free-form
help from Triton admins.  Second, there may be a *short*,
*introductory* presentation on some topic that can get a discussion
started.  Both usually happen in parallel, and we decide the best
organization each week.

Come if you want to:

-  Solve problems
-  Discuss bigger problems
-  Network with others who are doing similar work
-  Learn something new
-  Give feedback

Schedule
========

-  Days: Triton garage is every week from 14:00-15:00 on Tuesdays. Every
   other week, there is a short talk. Otherwise, we are only there for
   questions and support.
-  Time: We promise to be there only the first 30 minutes. After this,
   we leave once we are done helping attendees. So if you are coming,
   come in the first 30 minutes.
-  Location: See below.  U121a_ and U121b_  (in main building),
   T4_ (CS building).
