Jupyter Workshop, spring 2019
=============================

This workshop is to introduce the Aalto community to the Aalto
JupyterHubs and how they can be used for teaching and research.  Most
likely, the main focus of this workshop will be teaching and students,
but research uses will be discussed too.  The workshop will introduce
new users to Jupyter and also guide the future development of the
services.  The main audience is teachers, but any interested people
are welcome to attend.



Date/time: 2019-03-08, 10:00-12:00

Location: T4, CS building.

Registration: none, just show up.

focused on practical examples and discussion.

* Aalto JupyterHubs: jupyter.cs and jupyter.triton
* nbgrader - how to use, limitations, etc
* nbgrader and course set up at Aalto
* How to best construct notebooks for teaching
* Examples from previous courses
* Discussion: what direction should development go?

About Aalto JupyterHubs
-----------------------

`Jupyter <https://jupyter.org>`__ is an interactive computing
ecosystem.  It is most known for the Jupyter (formerly IPython)
notebooks, which combine code, documentation, and output together in a
usable form.  JupyterHub provides multiuser access over the web: Aalto
provides two, :doc:`one for all Aalto users, in particular students
and with support for courses <../aalto/jupyterhub>` and :doc:`one for
research, as part of Triton <../triton/apps/jupyter>`.
