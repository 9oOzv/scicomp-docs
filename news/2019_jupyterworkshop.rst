Jupyter Workshop, 8 March 2019
==============================

This workshop is to introduce the Aalto community to the Aalto
JupyterHubs and how they can be used for teaching (including
independent projects) and research.  The workshop has the goals of
introducing new users to Jupyter, providing advice on implementation
in courses, and guiding future development.  The main audience is
teachers, but any interested people are welcome to attend, but
research uses will be discussed too.


Date/time: 2019-03-08, 10:00-12:00

Location: T4, CS building.

Registration: none, just show up.

Currently being decided, probably topics below.  The first 30-60

for those who want to actively use.

* Aalto JupyterHubs: jupyter.cs and jupyter.triton
* nbgrader - how to use, limitations, etc
* nbgrader and course set up at Aalto
* How to best construct notebooks for teaching
* Examples from previous courses
* Discussion: what direction should development go?

About the Aalto JupyterHubs
---------------------------

`Jupyter <https://jupyter.org>`__ is an interactive computing
ecosystem.  It is most known for the Jupyter (formerly IPython)
notebooks, which combine code, documentation, and output together in a
usable form.  JupyterHub provides multiuser access over the web: Aalto
provides two, :doc:`one for all Aalto users, in particular students
and with support for courses <../aalto/jupyterhub>` and :doc:`one for
research, as part of Triton <../triton/apps/jupyter>`.
