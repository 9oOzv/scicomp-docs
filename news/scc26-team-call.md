# Student Cluster Competition team call

**Unlock your potential and dominate the future of computing – join our SCC team today\!**

Aalto University and the University of Helsinki in collaboration with CSC – IT Center for Science are assembling two elite teams of six students each for the Student Cluster Competition (SCC) at the prestigious International Supercomputing Conference ‘26 (ISC26, isc-hpc.com).

The SCC is a world-class platform for students passionate about High-Performance Computing (HPC) to hone their skills and gain valuable insights into the dynamic field of supercomputing.

Our teams will dive into the Virtual online competition, engaging in a multi-week marathon to build and optimize software solutions for a variety of HPC challenges. Participants will focus on refining applications, employing parallel processing strategies, and leveraging diverse software and algorithms on cluster computers to achieve maximum efficiency and performance.

We are seeking team players with the following qualifications:

## Essential Skills (at least one required):

* You are a senior Bachelor, Master, or PhD student  
* Experience with Linux and bash scripting  
* Skilled in building applications in Linux  
* Proficient in at least one programming language (C, C++, Fortran)  
* Studies in applied sciences (Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics, etc.)  
* Linux system administration expertise

## Desired Skills (training provided):

* Experience with parallel computing (MPI, OpenMP, CUDA)  
* Understanding of CPU and GPU architectures  
* Experience with HPC systems (university clusters, supercomputers)

Candidates must demonstrate motivation, eagerness to learn, and a commitment to contributing to the team. CSC, alongside Aalto and HY, will offer comprehensive training and coaching.

We value diversity and inclusiveness and strongly encourage applications from women and other underrepresented groups in the field. Apply with a cover letter (explaining why you should be selected) and a CV by Wed 17.9.2025.

*Please send your cover letter and CV together in a single email with the subject line **'SCC26 Team Application'** to either Aaron (HY) or Ivan (Aalto), see contacts below. In the cover letter please tell us the following:*

* *What excites you about high performance computing?*  
* *Why would you be a good fit for the team?*  
* *A description of your current skills and experience in HPC*

## Details:

While we're forming the teams for competition application, acceptance isn’t guaranteed. Selection is competitive and contingent on team quality and application strength.

Along with the coaching that significantly boosts your skills, participation will bring study credits (ECTS) to acknowledge your dedication and effort during preparation and competition.

Joint training sessions will be held from December to February, consisting of six onsite sessions (various locations around Espoo/Helsinki at CSC, Aalto, HY), each lasting 3 hours. These sessions will equip you with the necessary skills and knowledge for the competition. In addition to the training, there will be homework and you will be expected to collaborate and work with your team remotely.

The online competition will begin at the end of March and span several weeks. During this period, you will need to dedicate your free time to tackle the assigned HPC challenges and contribute as much as possible to the team's efforts. Please plan your studies and traveling accordingly to ensure you can fully participate.

Prepare to immerse yourself in a world of computing innovation and teamwork, making the most out of this unique experience\!
