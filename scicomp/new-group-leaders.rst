New group leaders: what to know about computational research
============================================================

As a new group leader, how can you make the most of your future
group's computational work, so that it becomes an investment rather
than a liability?



Why plan in advance?
--------------------

* Your group's work is valuable.
* Over time, your work's value can grow...
* ... or it can be lost every 5 years as your group changes.



What usually goes wrong?
------------------------
At a group level, these often happen to semi-computational groups:

* Every researcher starts a project over from scratch
* Researchers leave, previous work becomes unusable (your group
  completely changes every ~5 years!)
* If you don't work at it, your group's software and data gets more
  and more disorganized, until it becomes unusable.  It limits what
  you can do in the future.

At an individual level:

* Time wasted with mistakes
* Time wasted when one can't repeat analysis for reviews
* Desire to hide or not share code because it's "messy", which
  promotes the above cycle continuing.  And less Open Science.



Step 1: Define how you work together
------------------------------------
This is kind of meta, but: do you want to be a group of people
connected by supervisor, or a team that works together?

- Is co-working limited to coffee chats and presentations at group
  meetings?

  - Do these presentations comment only on the final results?
  - Or do you discuss and praise good practices for getting those
    results?

- Or on the other end, are you co-developing the same project?
- Are you a team, or a bunch of independent contractors?



Planning vs making the plan
---------------------------
     Plans are useless, planning is indispensable *- Dwight Eisenhower*

* Different grants request you make a **data management plan** and
  I've seen ideas of **software management plan** for the future.
* If you making a plan just for a grant, I think that's the wrong
  idea.  You want everything you do to *go beyond single projects.*

My suggestion: make a "practical plan" for important aspects, in your
group's documentation area.  Update it as needed.



Group documentation
-------------------
A single place for reference on groups practices helps with onboarding
and keeping things consistent and usable over time.

- A group wiki is a good place to start.
- Minimum documentation about how you want things done - or how they
  are *actually* being done.
- But not so strict that you can't make progress in the future.
- Index of important software, data, and other resources

  - But description of the software/data should be with the them, not
    in the group docs.

- Can you make everything open.  e.g. your group website contains this
  reference information, so it also serves as an advertisement?



Skill development
-----------------

Many people learn basic programming.  Far fewer people learn best
practices to get the best value out of it.

- Every researcher should know a minimum of some version control
- This, and other important tools are covered in `CodeRefinery
  <https://coderefinery.org>`__
- Consider attending a CodeRefinery as a team
- At least one interested person per group should become more of a
  specialist, so that they can mentor and support others.  Hire
  someone interested?

But there is also informal learning, **mentoring**:

- You learn more from co-working than courses.
- You need good, active mentoring (not weekly status checks, but real
  co-working)
- Desks next to each other where you can see each others screens
- Pair programming
- But, as an academic supervisor, you probably don't have time to
  mentor.  How do you get mentoring?

  - Set up group to work together
  - Time and motivation for self-learning
  - Encourage a internal specialist who can mentor for you.



Why talk so much about teaching and mentoring, rather than practices?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

* Unlike many topics, we can't rely on academic courses to prepare
  your group members.
* In all my experience, good software and data practices comes from
  sharing good internal practices.
* I know supervisors can't do everything, but hopefully they can
  promote what they need internally.



Software in research
--------------------

* Software allows you to do far more than one can alone.
* If made well, it is transforms research.

  * ... but can also be one of the most complex tasks you do.

* Who develops it?

  * You can and will use software developed by others
  * Many groups develop their own internally: either shared or
    everyone individually
  * If you make something good, you may want to release it so that
    others can use it - and cite you.


Software: tools
---------------

Version control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Tracks changes

  * solves: Everything just broke but I don't know what I changed.
  * solves: I'm getting different results than when we submitted the
    paper.

* Allows collaboration

  * solves: "can you send me the latest version of the code"
  * solves: "we're using two different versions, too bad"

* Creates a single source of truth for the code

  * Not different scattered around on everyone's computers

* Most common these days: :doc:`git </scicomp/git>`

Github, Gitlab, etc.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Version control platforms**
* Online hosting platforms for git (others available)
* Very useful to keep stuff organized
* Makes a lot of stuff below possible.

Issue tracking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Version control platforms provide **issue trackers**
* Important bugs, improvements, etc. can be closely tracked.

Change proposals (aka "pull requests")
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Feature of version control platforms like Github or Gitlab
* People should work together, but maybe not everyone should be able to
  modify everything, right?
* Contributors (your group or otherwise) can contribute without risk
  of messing things up.
* For this to work you *need to actually review, improve, and accept them*

Testing
~~~~~~~
* How do you know your code is correct?  Try running it, right?
* But what happens if you change it later?
* **Software testing** is a concept of writing tests, which can
  automatically verify functionality.
* You write tests, and then anytime you make a change later, the tests
  verify it still works.

Publication and release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* If you invest in your software, you probably want to share it

  * "If we release a paper on some method, and we don't include *easy
    to use* software to run it, our impact will be tiny compared to
    what it could be." - CS Professor

* Good starting point: make the repository open on Github/Gitlab
* Can also be archived on Zenodo (or other places) to make it
  citeable.
* Do all work expecting that it might be made open someday.  Separate
  public and secret information into different repositories.


Working together on code
------------------------

Things that can go wrong if people work together:

* One person changes something and it breaks for everyone

  * Version control and testing help with this.



Data storage
------------

- Discourage single-user storage spaces (laptop, home directories)
- Use common shared spaces instead
- Network drives

  - Usually used via a remote system
  - Some can be locally mounted on your own laptop for ease of use
  - Not the best for people who want to work on their own computer,
    but works.  Data can be synced.

Aalto Scientific Computing strategy:

- All mass storage provided in shared group directories.
- Request as many as your want - each one has a unique access control.
- Access and data can be passed on as the group evolves.


Data storage locations at Aalto University
------------------------------------------
* Own devices

  * Danger, no backups!  Personal devices are considered insecure.

* Aalto home directories

* Aalto network drives

  * Large, secure, backed-up.  Request from your department or from
    Aalto IT Services.
  * 10-100 GB range is easy.

* Triton HPC Cluster

  * Very large, fast, direct cluster access, but not backed up.
  * 10s-100s of TB.

* Public data repositories

  * For open data



Computing
---------

There are a range of computing options: (easy to use, small) â‹„ (harder
to use, large)

- Own devices

- Remote servers

- Remote computer clusters

  - Aalto
  - CSC



Support
-------

It's dangerous to go alone.  Take us!

* There were many things above.
* Hopefully you got some ideas, but I don't think that anyone can do
  this alone (I learned everything by working with others)
* Rely on support and mentoring.

Some possibilities, if you are at Aalto:

* At Aalto: :doc:`Research Software Engineer consulting service </rse/index>`
* At Aalto: `Data Agents <https://www.aalto.fi/en/services/data-agents>`__



Summary: dos and don'ts
-----------------------

You are not allowed to

- Not use version control
- Not push to online repository
- Have critical data or material only on an own computer.
- Make something so chaotic that you can't organize it later
- Go alone

But you don't have to

- Start every code perfectly
- Do everything perfectly
- ... as long as you can improve it later, if needed.
- Know everything yourself.



Checklist
---------
- Set up group reference information (for example, wiki).
- Work with your supporters to create a basic outline of plan.
- Set up Github organization for group code
- Set up Gitlab organization for internal work (university Gitlab)
- Create your internal data/software management plan.
- (Think what code/data will be most reused, put it in one place, and
  make it reusable.)
- Send group members to CodeRefinery as they join.
