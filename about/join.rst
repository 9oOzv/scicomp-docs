Usage model and joining
=======================

Aalto Scientific Computing operates with a community stakeholder model and is
administered by the School of Science.  Schools, departments, and
other units join and contribute resources to get a fair-share of the
output.  There are two different components to join:

- HPC: Science-IT.  Get a share of computing resources via the :doc:`Triton
  computing cluster </triton/index>`.
- :doc:`Aalto Research Software Engineers (RSE) </rse/index>`: Support of the RSE program
  provides intensive hands-on support and service for research
  software development.


For everyone
------------

Aalto Scientific Computing gets university-level support already, so
our computing resources are usable by anyone doing research at Aalto
(with a limited share).
By joining further, a unit gets something even more valuable: time.
Our support for using our infrastructure is concentrated for member
departments which provide joint staff with us or support the :doc:`RSE
program </rse/index>`, in addition to a greater share of resources.


Staff network
-------------

*There is no Aalto Scientific Computing, just people who want to make
computing better.*

You might be a department IT staff member, a lab engineer, a skilled postdoc or a doctoral candidates who helps other researchers with their technical/computational challenges. Why not joining forces and join our network of helpers? There is no "Aalto Scientific Computing" on paper, only different
teams that work together to help researchers better than they could
alone.  We invite interested staff to join our community, :doc:`help
sessions </news/garage>`, infrastructure development, etc.  This
program is just being developed (as of 2020), but it roughly includes:

* Participation in admin meetings to help us develop infrastructure
  (e.g.  Triton) in the best way for your users

* Co-maintenance of infrastructure (for example, your unit's special
  software) on Triton and in out automated software deployment
  systems.

* Networking, to learn how to solve your users' problems more
  efficiently.

* Continual professional development

* This is not just for IT support or administrative support, but
  high-quality research support that connects all aspects of work.

This does not replace local support, it just makes it more powerful.

   How to take part.


Triton: computing and data storage resources
--------------------------------------------

:doc:`Triton </triton/index>` is the Aalto computing cluster, for
computationally and data-intensive research.  Users from members of the
community are allocated resources using a fair-share algorithm that
guarantees a level of resources at least proportional to the stake,
without the need for individual users to engage in separate
application processes and billing.

Each participating department/unit funds a fraction of costs and is
given an agreed share of resources.  These discussions are carried out
with the board of the Science-IT project.  Based on this agreed share,
units cover the running expenses of the project.  There is also direct
Aalto funding, which allows the entire Aalto community to access a
share of Triton for free.

However, computing is not just hardware: support and training is just
as critical.  To provide support, each unit that is a full member of
Science-IT is required to nominate a local support contact as their
first contact point.  Our staff tries to provide scientific computing
support to units without a support contact on a best-effort basis
(currently, that effort is good), but we must assume a basic level of
knowledge and attendance at our training courses.

Interested parties may open discussion with Science-IT at any time.
Using our standing procurement contracts, parties may order hardware
to be integrated into our cluster with dedicated or priority access
(or standalone usage), allowing you to take advantage of our extensive
software stack and management expertise, with varying levels of
dedicated access: a share of total compute time, partitions with
priority access, private interactive nodes, and so on.  Please contact
us for details.


Scientific software: research software engineers
------------------------------------------------

The :doc:`Research Software Engineer program </rse/index>` provides
specialists in software and data, who can be contracted out to
projects to provide close support.  The goal is not just to perform a
service, but to teach by hands-on mentoring.

For projects, the principle is that the project pays for help lasting
more than a few hours or days.  This can seamlessly come from project
money as a researcher salary.

Units (departments, schools) can also join to get a *basic service* -
their members can receive short-term support without any billing
needed.  Their members will also receive priority for the project
services.

For more information, see the :doc:`RSE for units </rse/units>` page.
