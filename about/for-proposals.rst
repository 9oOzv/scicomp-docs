Focus on Triton
---------------

Computing and modelling are strategic areas of Aalto University. To
support research in these scopes the university is committed to
provide proper hardware resources and supporting personnel on long
term basis. Currently Aalto Science-IT provides a system with about 10000 computing
cores. The System also contains 150 NVIDIA cards for
GPU computing and over 5 PB of fast storage capacity suitable for Big
Data needs. All parts are connected with a fast Infiniband network to
support parallel computing and fast data access. To keep the resources
competitive Aalto Science-IT annually upgrades the system based on the needs of
researchers.

All resources are integrated with the national resources allowing easy
migration to even larger resources when necessary. These include
e.g. University dedicated OpenStack based cloud resources and access
to thousands of servers via the national computing grid. Furthermore
Aalto Science-IT provides much preconfigured software and hands on support to make
the usage for researchers as effective as possible. On the personnel
side Science-IT has six permanent Ph.D. level staff to keep the system
running and providing teaching and consultation for researchers.


Acknowledging Triton in publications
------------------------------------


Remember you need to acknowledge Aalto Science-IT in your papers if you 
use Triton and its scratch filesystem.  See the
:doc:`acknowledging Triton page </triton/acknowledgingtriton>` for
instructions on how to do that and some boilerplate text.



Focus on data
-------------


Computing and data are strategic areas in Aalto University.

The university provides data management and computing solutions
throughout the data lifecycle.  The university provides free storage
to researchers of essentially unlimited size, provided that the data
is managed well.  Data storage includes 5PB of high-performance 
non-backed-up Lustre filesystem space connected directly to the Triton computing 
cluster for efficient and secure analysis, and 1PB of reliable backed-up 
storage space for longer-term storage. Expert staff, both technical and 
administrative, provide advice and hands-on support in data storage,
computation, FAIR principles, data management planning, as well as
computation.

Data management is designed with a focus on security.  Recommended
storage locations are centrally located for security.  Computing nodes 
and Lustre data storage servers are physically located at CSC, Keilaranta 
14, Espoo. The server room is certified security level 3 (VAHTI-3) i.e. 
only authorized personnel with clearance are given access to it and there 
is continuous camera surveillance. All data is access controlled by passwords 
and individual-level authorization, and firewalled to university networks.

Aalto ITS data storage is directly integrated into Aalto’s sustainable 
computing environment. Storage is double-redundant and includes the possibility 
to roll back to previous points in time, with disaster recovery management. 
In addition to confidential data processing, there are multiple encrypted and/or 
audited storage environments for sensitive data processing. For IoT, Aalto ITS 
utilizes public cloud computing providers for case-specific construction of services. 
Aalto has IT infrastructure personnel, who can help researchers with building the relevant 
solution for the use case.  


Focus on connectivity  
---------------------


Aalto researchers can use the Low Power Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN), a data network for Internet of things (IoT) devices with nationwide coverage, free of charge. Using this network, a device can send a small amount of data with minimal power which makes batteries last long. LoRaWAN is suitable for static and mobile sensors that are operated by batteries. Aalto IT services provide support and configure the network together with the user. In Finland, public mobile networks support also NB-IoT (Narrowband IoT) technology. 

Aalto campus area has a specific research environment for 5G connectivity, that can be used for developing and testing 5G technology and applications.  
On the campus area connectivity is ensured via a 100 Gbit/s fault-tolerant internet connection, 1 – 10 Gbit/s connections to workstations and servers, and extensive wireless coverage. Secure connectivity outside Aalto-campus is also possible by various technologies, e.g. VPN.  


Research environment: research software engineers
-------------------------------------------------

The Aalto Research Software Engineer (RSE) team provides a specialized
advice and service in research software, data, and computing so that
any researcher can accomplish the best science without being held back
by technological problems.  Typical tasks including implementing a
method bettor or faster than could otherwise be done, or ensuring that
results are as open and reusable as possible so that the full impact
of the work can be realized.  RSE staff are professional researchers
with years of experience in computational sciences, and work
seamlessly with the rest of the Science-IT team.  For the School of
Science, basic services are included as part of overheads, or
longer-term services can be funded from specific research projects.

This grant will make use of the Aalto Research Software Engineer
program to hire high-quality TOPIC specialists.  This program provides
PhD-level personnel to work on THINGS, which allows the other staff
on this project to focus on YYY.  Research software engineers do not need to be
independently recruited, and are available for consultation also before and
after the project.  This service is provided by Aalto Scientific
Computing, which also provides high-performance computing resources for your project.
The Research Software Engineering service is integrated into computing
services as a consistent package.

(for basic service, for now only SCI) The service is available as a
basic consulting service for free.

(for paid services) This project receives dedicated service from the
