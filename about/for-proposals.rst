Boilerplate text for grant proposals
====================================

Below are various texts which describe our resources, suitable for
inclusion in grant applications an the like.  There are various types
suitable for different purposes.

If you create your own texts and would like to share them, send them
to us.

.. warning::

   These are starting points, not something that should be included
   as-is.  The texts need to somehow be combined and tailored to your
   particular proposal - contact `Aalto Research Services (pre-award)
   <https://www.aalto.fi/en/services/research-and-innovation-services#3-school-teams-helping-researchers>`__
   for advice on proposals, or whoever the right person is for the
   services themselves.



Focus on Triton
---------------

Computing and modelling are strategic areas of Aalto University. To
support research in these scopes the university is committed to
provide proper hardware resources and supporting personnel on long
term basis. Currently we provide a system with about 10000 computing
cores. The System also contains 150 NVIDIA cards for
GPU computing and over 5 PB of fast storage capacity suitable for Big
Data needs. All parts are connected with a fast Infiniband network to
support parallel computing and fast data access. To keep the resources
competitive we annually upgrade the system based on the needs of
researchers.

All resources are integrated with the national resources allowing easy
migration to even larger resources when necessary. These include
e.g. University dedicated OpenStack based cloud resources and access
to thousands of servers via the national computing grid. Furthermore
we provide much preconfigured software and hands on support to make
the usage for researchers as effective as possible. On the personnel
side we have five permanent Ph.D. level staff to keep the system
running and providing teaching and consultation for researchers.



Focus on data
-------------

Computing and data are strategic areas in Aalto University.

The university provides data management and computing solutions
throughtout the data lifecycle.  The university provides free storage
to researchers of essentially unlimited size, provided that the data
is managed well.  Data storage includes 5PB of high-performance Lustre
filesystem space connected directly to a computing cluster for
efficient and secure analysis, and 1PB of reliable, backed-up storage
space for longer-term storage.  Expert staff, both technical and
administrative, provide advice and hands-on support in data storage,
computation, FAIR principles, data management planning, as well as
computation.

Data management is designed with a focus on security.  Recommended
storage locations are centrally located for security.  Computing nodes and data storage servers are physically located at CSC, Keilaranta 14, Espoo. The server room is certified security level 3 (VAHTI-3) i.e. only authorized personnel with clearance are given access to it and there is continuous camera surveillance. All data is
access controlled by passwords and individual-level authorization, and
firewalled to university networks.



Research environment: research software engineers
-------------------------------------------------

The Aalto Research Software Engineer (RSE) team provides a specialized
advice and service in research software, data, and computing so that
any researcher can accomplish the best science without being held back
by technological problems.  Typical tasks including implementing a
method bettor or faster than could otherwise be done, or ensuring that
results are as open and reusable as possible so that the full impact
of the work can be realized.  RSE staff are professional researchers
with years of experience in computational sciences, and work
seamlessly with the rest of the Science-IT team.  For the School of
Science, basic services is included as part of overheads, or
longer-term services can be funded from specific research projects.



Research software engineering services

(this text must be tuned to your grant, replace the parts in CAPITAL LETTERS)

This grant will make use of the Aalto Research Software Engineer
program to hire high-quality TOPIC specialists.  This program provides
PhD-level personnel to work on THINGS, which allows the other staff
on this project to focus on YYY.  Research software engineers do not need to be
independently recruited, and are available for consultation also before and
after the project.  This service is provided by Aalto Scientific
Computing, which also provides high-performance computing resources for our project.
The Research Software Engineering service is integrated into computing
services as a consistent package.

(for basic service, for now only SCI) The service is available as a
basic consulting service for free.

(for paid services) This project receives dedicated service from the
Research Software Engineering group, funded as researcher salary from
this grant.  During this period, one of the Aalto research software engineers joins this
project as a researcher, equal to all other project employees.



Acknowledgement for papers
--------------------------

Remember you need to in your papers if you use it.  See the
:doc:`acknowledging Triton page </triton/acknowledgingtriton>` for
instructions on how to do that and some boilerplate text
