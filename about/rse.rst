Research Software Engineers
===========================

In 2020, Aalto Scientific Computing is trialing a Research Software
Engineer (RSE) program to improve the quality of our scientific
computing.  "`Research software engineer <rse-def_>`_" is a recent
term for a longstanding role: someone that works at the interface of
research and software development, but not fully either.

.. _rse-def: https://rse.ac.uk/who/

A basic service is provided for certain departments, and an dedicated
service for groups who provide their own funding.  Departments/school
and groups can co-fund the program to gain a dedicated share.

**This is draft information about a pilot project, information is
subject to change.**



For researchers
---------------

You program in your daily work, and you know something is missing:
your code is less organized, less efficient, less managed than others,
and it's affecting the quality of your work.  Or maybe you don't know
how to start your project, or publish it.  You're too busy with the
science to have time to focus on the software.

**Basic service:** You can apply to the Research Software Engineer
(RSE) program for support and mentorship.  One of our trained RSEs
will work with you for a short period to begin or improve your
project.  The goal is not just to do it for you, but to show you by
example so that you can do it yourself later.  Typical basic tasks
include:

* Setting up a project in version control with all the features
* Automating a workflow
* Optimizing some code
* Preparing code for release and publication
* Making existing software more modular
* Help properly using, for example, machine learning library
  pipelines
* Setting up automatic software testing
* Transforming projects from individual to collaborative.
* Generalized "code clean-up" which takes a project from development
  to stablalized

**Dedicated service:** Our RSEs may also provide
programming-as-a-service for specific projects.  Normally, this would
be for larger projects which need long-term support and maintenance,
including those which just want a service and not necessarily to learn
how to do it themselves.  As part of this service, one can get:

* Developing or maintaining specific software or services.
* Software support that lasts beyond the time frame of a single
  student's attention
* Software development as a service
* Adding features to existing software



For RSE candidates
------------------

Do you like coding and research, but don't want an academic career
path with publications as your sole purpose?  Be a Research Software
Engineer with us!  Our pilot is designed to bridge the gap between
academic research and a future career in research software or a
research scientist in a company.

If (some of) the following apply to you, you are a good candidate:

* I like the academic environment, but don't want to focus just on
  making publications.
* I am reasonably good at some programming concepts, and am eager to
  learn more.  I know one language well, can shell script, and
  generally familiar with Linux.
* I am interested in going to a scientist-developer kind of role in a
  company, but need more experience before I can make the transition.

We strongly prefer good computational researchers (PhD level
preferred) who can improve their software development skills than the
other way around.  This role can be combined with other roles, but
note that this is not targeted to those who intend to follow a
tenure-track academic career path.



For funders
-----------

Our pilot is funded by departments and schools, and members of these
units can receive the basic services free of charge (in accordance to
the shares of funding).  If a research group would like dedicated
advanced services (see list above), they can directly fund this
program.  This could be, for example, co-funding salaries or

Benefits to schools/departments:

* Increase the quality of efficiency of your research.  Your
  researchers focus on their science while improving their coding
  skills passively.
* Provide hands-on technical research services to your community at a
  higher level than basic IT.

Benefits to groups:

* Receive staff/on-call software development expertise within your
  group, without having to fund or hire a full-time.
* Your RSEs get joint training and share competence within our RSE
  group.



Implementation
--------------

(draft)

Basic services:

* Researchers are selected based on an light application and
  consultation or recommendation from Science-IT.  The RSE program
  balances its time in proportion to its funding from
  schools/departments/groups.

* Ranking criteria includes potential to create lasting improvement of
  skills within a research group, improvement in hardware efficiency,
  number of people benefited, buy-in of group leader, open nature of
  projects (we have a preference for open projects which can serve as
  an example to others), potential for high-impact open software, and
  diversity considerations.

* Typical time frame is generally between one day and a week.

* General timeframe: initial consultation to discuss starting point,
  discussion to decide on target state, RSE provides advice on
  additional training, co-working on the project, follow-up advice as
  needed.  RSE will ideally work from the same office as the
  researcher.


Dedicated service:

* All parameters as agreed in funding discussions.

* Can be implemented as co-funding of salaries or usage fees.

* Time frame typically months or more.  Can include long-term
  maintenance or support at a small full-time equivalent.
