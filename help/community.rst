SciComp Community
=================

Let's face it: we learn more from each other than from classes.  How
can we learn from each other if we don't have a community?  Join the
Aalto SciComp community to make the most of your time here.

Aalto Scientific Computing hosts many different channels to get
involved.  Through it, you can:

* Network with others.

* Share knowledge among ourselves (maybe have relevant training,
  too).  We can't be experts in everything, so if users can help each
  other, everyone benefits.

* Take part in developing our services - basically, be a voice of the
  users.

* More directly help the community by, for example, :doc:`directly updating
  this site </README>`, helping to develop services, or teaching with us.



SciComp Garage and issues
-------------------------

Currently, most of our interaction happens in the daily :doc:`SciComp
Garage <garage>`, which is a daily meeting where we help others (and
learn ourselves).  If you hang out there, you will learn a lot.

If you subscribe to the `Triton issue tracker
<https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/AaltoScienceIT/triton/issues>`__, you
will see a lot of questions and answers, and thus learn a lot.



Aalto community chats
---------------------

We have biweekly chats for the Aalto RSE/scientific computing
poweruser meetings.  This is a way to network with similarly-minded
people.  Check back for updates on when these are.



Mailing lists
-------------

* If you have a :doc:`Triton account </triton/index>`, you are on the
  triton-users mailing list already.  Many :doc:`training
  </training/index>` and other events are announced there.
* If you do not have a Triton account, the :doc:`scicomp-announcements
  mailing list </training/scicomp-announcements-maillist>` provides
  the same information.  `Subscribe
  here<https://list.aalto.fi/mailman/listinfo/scicomp-announcements>`__.
* Join `our RSE mailing list
  <https://list.aalto.fi/mailman/listinfo/rse>`__ for information on
  research software related topics.



Chat
----

* Join the `Aalto Scientific Computing group on Aalto Microsoft Teams
  <asc-teams_>`__.  The invite code is ``e50tyij``.  In practice, we
  watch it for questions but it's not the most active place (but it
  could be).
* We often hang out on the `CodeRefinery chat
  <https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/chat/>`__, and there is an
  ``#aalto`` stream there.
