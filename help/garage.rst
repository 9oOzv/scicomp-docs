Scicomp garage
==============


If you need more help than the issue trackers, this is the place to
be.  It's not just Triton, but all aspects of scientific computing.

Come if you want to:

-  Solve problems
-  Discuss and figure out what your problem really is
-  Brainstorm the best strategy are for your problems
-  Work with someone on your issues in real time
-  Network with others who are doing similar work and learn something
   new

Notes:

* All garages are open to all people (but see the specialities).

* You don't have to have a specific question, you can come by just to
  chat, listen, or figure out if you should have a question.

You can meet us online, every weekday, at 13:00, `online via zoom

into our office to ask for help. If you are not sure whether we can help you, come
and chat with us anyway and we can figure out a solution together.


* This doesn't replace email or the `Triton issue
  tracker
  <https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/AaltoScienceIT/triton/issues>`__
  for clearly-defined tasks.  Garage is good for discussion,
  brainstorming, and deciding the best path.   If in doubt, come to
  garage and we will help you decide.  Many people make an issue, then
  come to garage to discuss.

* Arrive between 13:00 - 13:15.  We leave at 13:15 if there is no one
  around (and the person you need to talk to may leave).  Please don't
  arrive early since we another meeting then.  Program always ends at
  14:00.
  
* We have some **focus days** (see list below) to ask about specific topics 
  and make sure you find the right person to help you, but you can always
  visit on any day and ask anything not related to the "focus".

* Join on Zoom via https://aalto.zoom.us/j/61322268370 .  If joining
  by web browser, use Chrome.  Audio doesn't work with Firefox or
  Safari.


**Focus days**

We have added some **focus days** (see list below), but you can always visit on any day and ask anything not related to the "focus".

* **Mondays** no special focus, come ask anything.
* **Tuesdays** are Research Software Engineering focus days: Come ask about
  issues with your code or software tools you use. We can also help with basic methodological or statistical issues.
* **Wednesdays** are Data focus days, this is in joint collaboration with the `Aalto Data Agents network <https://www.aalto.fi/en/services/data-agents-and-data-advisor>`__
  from all Aalto schools. Come ask about research data management, data sharing/reusing/opening, data versioning, 
  sensitive data, data management plans, legal and ethical issues with research data, workflows for working with big datasets. 
* **Thursdays** are Triton focus days: Come ask about code parallelization, slurm job submissions, and usage of Triton cluster. 
* **Fridays** are CS focus days.

departments
