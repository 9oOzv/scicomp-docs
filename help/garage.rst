.. admonition:: Summer schedule for the garage
   :class: important

   **News:** Monday 20 June 2022: no garage, summer Science-IT event.

   We will try to continue Garage during the summer, but there are
   many staff vacations during July.

   - We aren't canceling garage but not promising to be there every
     day.  Our support on certain topics may be limited.
   - You can drop by and see if someone is there.  Open an :ref:`issue
     <issuetracker>` if something is urgent or important and we'll
     tell you what to do (for example, a garage day to attend or
     asynchronous help).


If you need more help than the issue trackers, this is the place to
be.  It's not just Triton, but all aspects of scientific computing.

Come if you want to:

-  Solve problems
-  Discuss and figure out what your problem really is
-  Brainstorm the best strategy are for your problems
-  Work with someone on your issues in real time
-  Network with others who are doing similar work and learn something
   new

What kind of issues can we help with:

- Code and Software:

  - Issues with your code or software tools you use (e.g. debugging, setting up software, linking libraries)
  - Code parallelization
  - Code versioning, git, testing

- Data Management:

  - Data management plans, data sharing
  - Handling of sensitive data and general legal and ethical (to some extent) questions about research data
  - Workflows for big datasets
  - Data versioning

- Triton cluster:

  - Slurm job submissions
  - Cluster usage
  - Script setup
  - Module management / Library loading

- General:

  - Basic methodological or statistical issues

Notes:

* All garages are designed for researchers and staff working in Aalto (or those who have a need to contact us).

* You don't have to have a specific question, you can come by just to
  chat, listen, or figure out if you should have a question.

.. admonition:: Summer schedule for the garage
   :class: important

   See summer schedule at the top of this page.

You can meet us online, every weekday, at 13:00, `online via zoom
<https://aalto.zoom.us/j/61322268370>`__.  Imagine this like walking
into our office to ask for help. If you are not sure whether we can help you, come
and chat with us anyway and we can figure out a solution together.


* This doesn't replace email or the `Triton issue
  tracker
  <https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/AaltoScienceIT/triton/issues>`__
  for clearly-defined tasks.  Garage is good for discussion,
  brainstorming, and deciding the best path.   If in doubt, come to
  garage and we will help you decide.  Many people make an issue, then
  come to garage to discuss.

* Arrive between 13:00 - 13:15.  We leave at 13:15 if there is no one
  around (and the person you need to talk to may leave).  Please don't
  arrive early since we have another meeting then.  Program always ends at
  14:00.
  
* We have some **focus days** (see list below) to ask about specific topics 
  and make sure you find the right person to help you, but you can always
  visit on any day and ask anything not related to the "focus".

* Join on Zoom via https://aalto.zoom.us/j/61322268370 .  If joining
  by web browser, use Chrome.  Audio doesn't work with Firefox or
  Safari.


NBE/PHYS
--------

PHYS, NBE, and ITS (Aalto IT Services) staff are part of the Garage sessions every Monday and Wednesday. 
Regular reminders are sent to the department personnel lists.



Focus days
----------

We have added some **focus days** (see list below), but you can always visit on any day and ask anything not related to the "focus". But even if today is not the focus day for your question: Better come along and ask your question now. Chances are good someone will know an answer.

* **Mondays** are NBE/PHYS focus days.
* **Tuesdays** are Research Software Engineering focus days: Come ask about
  issues with your code or software tools you use. We can also help with basic methodological or statistical issues.
* **Wednesdays** NBE/PHYS and Data focus days. Data days is in joint collaboration with the `Aalto Data Agents network <https://www.aalto.fi/en/services/data-agents-and-data-advisor>`__
  from all Aalto schools. Come ask about research data management, data sharing/reusing/opening, data versioning, 
  sensitive data, data management plans, legal and ethical issues with research data, workflows for working with big datasets. 
* **Thursdays** are Triton focus days: Come ask about code parallelization, slurm job submissions, and usage of Triton cluster. 
* **Fridays** are CS focus days.  


Others
------

Aalto IT services runs something similar `for some other schools and
departments

In person
=========

**In-person garages suspended for the time being for the
obvious reason.  The online garage above is more frequent and even
better, because you can reach more people and we can share screen
