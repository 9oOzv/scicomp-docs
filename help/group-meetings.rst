Periodic group meetings
=======================

This page applies to these departments so far: **CS, NBE, PHYS** (if
others want to join, let us know).

We would like to meet with each research group once a year.  This
isn't to advertise stuff to you, but to hear what you all need but
can't get, so that we can help you with that.  A group meeting
consists of your group plus a few members from technical services
(Science-IT, CS-IT, etc.)  which are relevant for your group, and we
here from you to guide our work.  Hopefully, we can immediately solve
some of your major problems.



Practical matters
-----------------

Ideally, someone (Science-IT, CS-IT, etc.) contacts your group leader
to arrange a time.  On the other hand, **contact your most local
(department) anytime to arrange a group meeting** - we are always
happy for an eager audience.  Your local support will request all the
other relevant parties to be there.

The group meeting would happen whenever is most convenient for you -
for example, during your regular group meetings.  **Please propose the
best times for you**.  One hour is sufficient.

**You don't need any particular preparation**.  If you do anything,
think about what computational/data/software tools you use and what
problems you have - you could have one or a few people tell about
the typical workflows of the group.



Topics
------

* Reminder of services available at Aalto and your department (short)

  * Computers and devices
  * Computing: local servers, :doc:`Triton </triton/index>`, `CSC
    <https://docs.csc.fi>`__, etc.  What do you usually use?
  * Data storage: Department storage (project, archive), Triton
    (scratch), cloud, any other needs?  What do you usually use?
  * Cloud services
  * Close specialist support teams

    * Department
    * :doc:`Science-IT </about/science-it>`
    * :doc:`/rse/index`

* Latest changes or improvements (short)
* Stories from the field: how do *you* do your work?
* Feedback: How do you do your work now?  What works well?  What
  doesn't work well?  What do you need in the future?  **Tell us all
  your complaints**, because we can't work on the right things without
  them. (long)



Discussion starters
-------------------

* Cloud vs shared workstations vs personal workstations vs laptops
* Where you store and share data
* Support channels
* Scientific computing, software needs
* GPUs
* Software installation
* Containers for difficult to run software (docker, singularity, etc)
* Cloud computing (CS + Openstack at CSC)
* WWW servers
* Open Science / Open Data / Open Access
* Software development: (tools, best practices, collaboration)
* :doc:`RSE service </rse/index>`
* Data-driven research: need more support?
* How to more closely support teaching/research
* Jupyter Notebooks, A+
* CSC services
* Email
