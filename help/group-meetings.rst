Periodic group meetings
=======================

We would like to meet with each research group once a year.  This
isn't to advertise stuff to you, but to hear what you all need but
can't get, so that we can help you with that.  A group meeting
consists of your group plus a few members from technical services
(Science-IT, CS-IT, etc.)  which are relevant for your group, and we
here from you to guide our work.  Hopefully, we can immediately solve
some of your major problems.



Practical matters
-----------------

Ideally, someone (Science-IT, CS-IT, etc.) contacts your group leader
to arrange a time.  In practice, this happens less frequently than
yearly, since everyone is busy.  Internally, we work together, there
is one meeting for all of the relevant support groups.

On the other hand, **contact us anytime to arrange a group meeting** -
we are always happy for an eager audience.

The group meeting would happen whenever is most convenient for you -
for example, during your regular group meetings.



Topics
------

* Reminder of services available at Aalto and your department (short)
* Latest changes or improvements (short))
* Feedback: How do you do your work now?  What works well?  What
  doesn't work well?  What do you need in the future?  **Tell us all
  your complaints, without them, how can we work on the right
  things?** (long)
