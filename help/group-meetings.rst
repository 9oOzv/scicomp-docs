Periodic group meetings
=======================

This page applies to these departments so far: **CS, NBE, PHYS** (if
others want to join, let us know).

We would like to meet with each research group once a year.  This
isn't to advertise stuff to you, but to hear what you all need but
can't get, so that we can help you with that.  A group meeting
consists of your group plus a few members from technical services
(Science-IT, CS-IT, etc.)  which are relevant for your group, and we
here from you to guide our work.  Hopefully, we can immediately solve
some of your major problems.



Practical matters
-----------------

Ideally, someone (Science-IT, CS-IT, etc.) contacts your group leader
to arrange a time.  On the other hand, **contact your most local
(department) anytime to arrange a group meeting** - we are always
happy for an eager audience.  Your local support will request all the
other relevant parties to be there.

The group meeting would happen whenever is most convenient for you -
for example, during your regular group meetings.  **Please propose the
best times for you**.  One hour is sufficient.

**You don't need any particular preparation**.  If you do anything,
think about what computational/data/software tools you use and what
problems you have - you could have one or a few people tell about
the typical workflows of the group.

* Latest changes or improvements (short)
* Feedback: How do you do your work now?  What works well?  What
  doesn't work well?  What do you need in the future?  **Tell us all
