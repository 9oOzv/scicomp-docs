User groups
===========

Often, there is specialized software or problem domains which need
more advanced documentation than the generic HPC talks.  Often, the
SciComp staff aren't experts in this particular domain, so we can't
provide immediate help without knowing more.  For this, we have user
groups: we meet with groups of users to discuss problems and create
solutions/documentation about them..


Existing user groups
--------------------

To be formed.

If you would like to create a user group, let us know.  The hardest
part is finding the users, so if you form the group of people and
schedule a time, it is very easy for us to come.  **To be clear, if
you bring people together and want to organize the group, we are very
happy and will take part and make it "official".**


User group meetings
-------------------

A user group meets periodically, and does various things.  At the
meeting is some SciComp staff as well as interested users, who want to
make a larger change than just solving their own problems.

* See examples of the software or problem in practice.
* Discuss the best solution of problems
* Collaboratively create documentation on the problem (which can be
  put straight at scicomp.aalto.fi, for example in
  :doc:`/triton/apps/index`).  We can create video demos,
  :doc:`examples </triton/examples/index>`, and more.
* Discuss how the infrastructure needs to be adapted to the actual use
  cases.
* Provide a network for informal support within research groups.


Preparing for a user group
--------------------------

* We will create a Triton issue about it and use that for
  communication.  Subscribe (= turn on notifications or comment) to
  the issue to get emails about it.

* Please submit some examples to the issue tracker, for example either
  things which already work (discuss + document) or things that don't
  yet (we will work together to improve + document).  This will form
  the main part of the meeting.  **We need examples!**
