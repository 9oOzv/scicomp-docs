Help
====

There are many ways to get help with your scientific computing and
data needs - in fact, so many you don't know what to use.  This page
lists who is available to help you, and ways of contacting them.


Formulate your question
-----------------------

We get many requests for help which are too vague to give a useful
response, so we delay while we try to find something better than
"please explain more", which slows everything down.  So, when sending
us a question, always try to clarify these points to get the fastest
solution:

* **Has it ever worked?**  (If so, what has changed?)
* **What are you trying to accomplish?**  (Your `ultimate goal
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem>`__, not current technical
  obstacle.)
* **What did you do?**  (Be specific enough to be reproducible - copy and
  paste exact commands you run, exact output messages, scripts, inputs, etc.)

If you don't know something, it's OK, just explain the best you can
and we'll go from there!  You can also chat with us to brainstorm
about issues in general, which helps to figure out these questions.  A
much more detailed guide is available from `Sigma2 documentation
<https://documentation.sigma2.no/getting_help/how_to_write_good_support_requests.html>`__.

We don't need a long story in the first message - we'll ask for more
later.  Try to cover these points, and we are happy to get your
message.



Places to ask for help
----------------------

At Aalto, there are many different places to ask for help.


Scientific Computing, Triton, and HPC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are focused on all aspects of computing and data, and mostly
consist of PhD-level researchers.  Our main sub-programs are
**high-performance computing** (:doc:`Triton </triton/index>`),
**research software help** (:doc:`RSEs </rse/index>`), and **data**.

* Problems with Triton, using Triton
* Help with software on Triton
* Data advice, FAIR data, confidential data, data organization
* Suggestions on tools and workflows to use
* General research software and research tools
* Advice on other Aalto services
* Advice on using CSC services
* Triton Accounts (by email)
* Increasing quotas, requesting group storage space (by email)

You can reach us by:

* Searching this website
* The `Triton issue tracker
  <https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/AaltoScienceIT/triton/issues>`__,
  which is where most Triton and scientific computing issues should
  go, even if not directly Triton related.
* Weekly :doc:`SciComp Garage sessions </help/garage>`, where you can
  informally chat.  Especially useful when your question is not yet
  fully defined.
* You can chat with us on `Aalto Microsoft Teams <https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a688ad82e41aa46d48ad978aea767419c%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=4089981d-a443-493d-ae3e-3df5c63caed6&tenantId=ae1a7724-4041-4462-a6dc-538cb199707e>`__.  The invite code is ``e50tyij``.  This is useful for quick things.
* There is also an email address (get it from our `internal wiki
  <https://wiki.aalto.fi/display/Triton/Getting+help>`__).  Use this
  only for things related to your account, quota, etc. - most other
  things go to the tracker above.

Department IT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CS, NBE, and PHYS have their own IT groups (among others, but those
are the Science-IT departments with the most support).  They handle
local matters and can reliably direct you to the right resources.
Department IT handles:

* Computers, laptops, personal devices
* Department data storage spaces
* Other department-managed tools and services

Reach them by:

* Department-specific email addresses

NBE and PHYS IT use the same email issue tracker (esupport) as Aalto
IT, so issues can be exchanged no matter which address you send an
issue to.  CS uses a different one, so you have to think a bit more
before sending something.




servicedesk, Aalto IT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

servicedesk()aalto.fi is the general IT Services service desk.  They
can handle things with account, devices, and so on.  They have a wide
range of responsibilities, but don't always know about local resources
that may be more appropriate for your needs.  There is an "IT Services
for Research" group which focuses on research needs

For students (who aren't also researchers), this is always your first
point of contact - in addition to your teacher.

servicedesk handles:

* Aalto accounts, passwords (including Triton passwords)
* University-wide data storage (work, teamwork, home directories)
* All university-wide common IT infrastructure: wifi, network,
  devices, websites, learning platforms, etc.
* Anything department stuff, when you are not in a department with
  local IT staff.

Reach them by:

* `Email or phone <https://www.aalto.fi/en/node/109031/>`__
* Browse the `IT Services for Research list
  <https://www.aalto.fi/en/services/it-services-for-research>`__



Research services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Aalto `Research Services
<https://www.aalto.fi/en/service-entities/research-and-innovation-services>`__
function more as project administative services rather than close
research support.  However, they provide important information for:

* Data management plans for funding applications
* Legal or ethical advice, making contracts and NDAs.
* Library services
* Applying for funding and administering it.

In many cases, you can chat with Aalto Scientific Computing and we can
give some initial practical advice.

Reach research services by:

* Contacting service email addresses at the link above
* Contacting school representatives findable at the link above



Community
---------

In addition to formal support, there is are informal activities, too:

* The weekly :doc:`SciComp Garage </help/garage>`, designed to provide
  one-on-one help, but we invite anyone to come, hang out in the main
  room, and network with us.  This is for basic help and brainstorming.

* Subscribe to notifications from the `Triton issue tracker
  <https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/AaltoScienceIT/triton/issues>`__
  even if you don't post there.  You will learn a lot.

* Sign up for the `Research software engineers and powerusers mailing
  list <https://list.aalto.fi/mailman/listinfo/rse>`__ and learn about
  more events that interest you.  This isn't the place to ask for
  basic help, but if you hang out here you will learn a *lot*.
