=============================
FCCI Tech (fka Behind Triton)
=============================

This is a series of talks about HPC infrastructure administration in
Practice.  It started as our internal kickstart to new members of our
staff, but the scope is expanded and now others interested in research
infrastructure is invited, though our orientation is still primarily
on the Triton team and FCCI admins.  Typical attendee are involved in
HPC cluster administration or scientific computing infrastructure.

In the future, this may turn into a more general "research
engineering" seminar series, once we are done with internal
explanations.

We share what our practices are, what we have learned, and informally
discuss.



Practicalities
==============

Time: The next speaker announce the time/date of the seminar the week
before. The speaker sends invitation with the Zoom link.

Duration: Rough estimate: ~40 minutes by the main speaker + ~20
minutes questions/discussion, if any.

Place: Zoom, ask for an invitation but it is usually the :doc:`garage
link </help/garage>`.

*It is not a right but a priveledge to participate. Free.*
