jupyter.cs news
===============


Summer/Autumn 2020
------------------

* You can now make a direct link that will spawn a notebook server,
  for example for a course with a slug of ``testcourse``:
  ```https://jupyter.cs.aalto.fi/hub/spawn?profile=testcourse``
  If the user is already running a server, it will **not switch
  to the new course**.  Expect some subtle confusion with this.  Full
  info in :doc:`faq-hints`.
