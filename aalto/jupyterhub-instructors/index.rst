JupyterHub for instructors
==========================

.. seealso::

   Main article with general usage instructions: :doc:`Jupyterhub for
   Teaching <../jupyterhub>`.  For research purposes, see :doc:`Triton
   JupyterHub </triton/apps/jupyter>`.

Nbgrader documentation is at https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/, and
is necessary reading to understand how to use it.  However, the
Noteable service documentation
(https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/documentation/) is generally much
better, and most of it is applicable to here as well.  The
information included in these is not duplicated here, and is
*required* in order to use jupyter.cs.

Below, you mostly find documentation specific to jupyter.cs and
important notes you do not find other places.
