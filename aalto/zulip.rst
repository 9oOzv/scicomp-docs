Zulip is a open-source chat platform, which Aalto hosts as a pilot.
It is used as a chat platform for some courses, and allows better
student and chat privacy.

The primary distinguishing feature of Zulip is **topics**, which
allows one to make order out of a huge number of messages.

Basics
------

There are various ways to follow:

* **Recent topics**, to see which *topics* have new information.

* **All messages**, to see everything that is being posted
  efficiently.

* **Per topic (or stream)**, when you click on a topic or stream name.
  Then you narrow down to a particular thread.

* The first is better to manage a flood of information (see what's
  new, click on relevant stuff, ignore all the rest).  The second is
  better when you are caught up and want to make sure you don't miss
  anything.  The third is good for catching up on something you
  don't remember.

* What many of us do is to first look at "Recent topics" after we come
  back after a break, see anything important, then scroll to the
  bottom of "All topics" to monitor new things.  If we see something
  we missed, we narrow to that topic to catch up.

Topics are grouped into **streams** (called this because it is
completely reasonable to follow everything at once via "All topics").
You can select the streams you are part of with the gear icon, above
the channel list.  It is good to occasionally look at this.



How to ask a question
---------------------

Seems obvious, doesn't it?  You can get the best and fastest answers
by helping to keep things organized.  These recommendations are mainly
for Q&A-forum type chats.

- First, search history to see if it has already been asked.

  - If so, click on the topic name.  You will narrow your view to see
    that entire conversation.

- If your question isn't answered yet, but is very similar to an
  existing topic, click on a message in that topic.  Then, when you
  ask, it will go to that same topic as a follow-up, and anyone else
  can narrow to see the whole history.

  - Unlike other chats, your message will *not* get lost, and people
    will both see that it is new *and* can see the history of that
    thread.

  - Your course can say what the threshold for "new topic" is.  Maybe
    they would have one topic per question pre-created or something
    clever like that.

- If you don't find anything relevant to follow up on, make a new topic.

  - Select the stream you want to post to (whatever fits best).

  - Enter the topic name down below: a few words, like an email
    subject.  For example, ``week 1 question 3``, ``integrals of
    complex functions``, ``exam preparation``.

  - Enter your message and send.

Others (or you...) can split or join topics if they want by going to
"edit message".  Don't worry, just ask!

By being organized, you can get both the benefits of quick chat with
the organization of not missing anything.



Apps
----

There are reasonable applications for most desktop and mobile
operating systems.  These don't send your data to any other services.



Open issues

We are aware of the following open issues:

- It is annoying to have one chat instance per course (but it seems to
  be).
