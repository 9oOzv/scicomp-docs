==================
Welcome, students!
==================

Welcome to the Aalto!  We are glad you are interested in scientific
computing and data.  These pages may be useful to you, but are
somewhat targeted to research usage.  However, these pages can still
serve as a good introduction to resources for scientific and
data-intensive computing at Aalto if you are a student.

If you are involved in a research group or doing researcher for a
professor/group leader, you are a researcher!  You should acquaint
yourself with all information on this site and use whatever you
need.

There are general IT instructions for students: `FI <itsFI_>`_ `SV
<itsSV_>`_ `EN <itsEN_>`_.  There are also `research-focused instructions
<itsr_>`_.

Accounts
========

In general, your Aalto account is identical to that which researchers
have --- the only difference is departmental affiliation.



Computation
===========

TODO: Aalto workstations and default scientific software.

The `shell servers
<https://inside.aalto.fi/display/ITServices/Servers+for+light+computing>`_
``brute`` and ``force`` are for light computing, and generally for
students.  You may find them useful, but can often be overloaded.

For GPU computing, the `Paniikki Linux computer lab
<http://usefulaaltomap.fi/#!/select/paniikki>`_ has GPUs in all
workstations and various software.  The instructions for :doc:`Aalto
workstations <../aalto/linux>` apply there as well (mostly).  The
software on these machines is managed by the Science-IT team.  This is
the place if you need to play with GPUs, deep learning, etc.

The use of :doc:`Triton <../triton/index>` is primarily for research
purposes.  If you are in a course with advanced computing needs, ask
the course instructor to contact us to discuss access for the class.
Your instructor will tell you when to contact us.



Data storage
============

Aalto home directories have a 20GB quota, and this is suitable for
small use.  Note that files here are lost once you leave Aalto, so
make sure you back up.

The `IT Services for Research <itsr_>`_ page contains some other cloud
services which may be useful for data storage.

Software
========
Various scientific software can be found for your own use via the
Aalto software portals (see the IT instructions at the top of the page)
